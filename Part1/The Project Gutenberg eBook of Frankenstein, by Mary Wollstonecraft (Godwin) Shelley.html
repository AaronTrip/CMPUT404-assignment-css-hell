<p class=3D"letter2"><i>To Mrs. Saville, England.</i></p>
<p class=3D"right">St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17=E2=80=94.</p>
<p>You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commenceme=
nt of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I a=
rrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my =
welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.</p>
<p>I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Peters=
burgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my n=
erves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breez=
e, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives=
 me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my=
 daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded tha=
t the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to =
my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the su=
n is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusi=
ng a perpetual splendour. There=E2=80=94for with your leave, my sister, I w=
ill put some trust in preceding navigators=E2=80=94there snow and frost are=
 banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpass=
ing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habita=
ble globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phen=
omena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitude=
s. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there disc=
over the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousa=
nd celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their see=
ming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosit=
y with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread=
 a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements=
, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to ind=
uce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he=
 embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of disc=
overy up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false,=
 you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all man=
kind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to tho=
se countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by=
 ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only=
 be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>
<p>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my let=
ter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heave=
n, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady pur=
pose=E2=80=94a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This e=
xpedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with =
ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the pros=
pect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround=
 the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purp=
oses of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas=E2=80=99 libr=
ary. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. Th=
ese volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them incre=
ased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father=
=E2=80=99s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in=
 a seafaring life.</p>
<p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whos=
e effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet=
 and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I=
 also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shake=
speare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how hea=
vily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortu=
ne of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earl=
ier bent.</p>
<p>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can,=
 even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great en=
terprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the wha=
le-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured c=
old, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the comm=
on sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics=
, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which=
 a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I =
actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted=
 myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud when my captain off=
ered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with th=
e greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.</p>
<p>And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpos=
e? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory=
 to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouragi=
ng voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is f=
irm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about=
 to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will d=
emand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of othe=
rs, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.</p>
<p>This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly qu=
ickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my op=
inion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is n=
ot excessive, if you are wrapped in furs=E2=80=94a dress which I have alrea=
dy adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and re=
maining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood fr=
om actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on t=
he post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.</p>
<p>I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my=
 intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the =
insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary=
 among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sa=
il until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how c=
an I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, =
will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,=
 or never.</p>
<p>Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on y=
ou, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all yo=
ur love and kindness.</p>

<a id=3D"letter2"></a>Letter 2</h2>
<p class=3D"letter2"><i>To Mrs. Saville, England.</i></p>
<p class=3D"right">Archangel, 28th March, 17=E2=80=94.</p>
<p>How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! =
Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel and=
 am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged ap=
pear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntles=
s courage.</p>
<p>But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the=
 absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no=
 friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there =
will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no =
one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts t=
o paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of fee=
ling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eye=
s would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitt=
erly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageou=
s, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes a=
re like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repai=
r the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too imp=
atient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self=
-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common a=
nd read nothing but our Uncle Thomas=E2=80=99 books of voyages. At that age=
 I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it w=
as only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important b=
enefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming a=
cquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twen=
ty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.=
 It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extende=
d and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) <i>keeping;</i> =
and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me a=
s romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.</=
p>
<p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on =
the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet=
 some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these r=
ugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage an=
d enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase m=
ore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishm=
an, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by=
 cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first b=
ecame acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unem=
ployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.</p>
<p>The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in =
the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circum=
stance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me ve=
ry desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent =
under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of =
my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutal=
ity exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and =
when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the=
 respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fo=
rtunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rathe=
r a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.=
 This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady =
of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, =
the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once bef=
ore the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing hersel=
f at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that=
 she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never c=
onsent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on bei=
ng informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He h=
ad already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass t=
he remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together =
with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself sol=
icited the young woman=E2=80=99s father to consent to her marriage with her=
 lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour=
 to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his countr=
y, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married accordi=
ng to her inclinations. =E2=80=9CWhat a noble fellow!=E2=80=9D you will exc=
laim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk=
, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders =
his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy w=
hich otherwise he would command.</p>
<p>Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceiv=
e a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in =
my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delay=
ed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dread=
fully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remar=
kably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I sh=
all do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence a=
nd considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.</=
p>
<p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undert=
aking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling=
 sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to=
 depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to =E2=80=9Cthe land of mist and=
 snow,=E2=80=9D but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed =
for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the =E2=
=80=9CAncient Mariner.=E2=80=9D You will smile at my allusion, but I will d=
isclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate e=
nthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the m=
ost imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul whic=
h I do not understand. I am practically industrious=E2=80=94painstaking, a =
workman to execute with perseverance and labour=E2=80=94but besides this th=
ere is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined i=
n all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even=
 to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore.</p>
<p>But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after ha=
ving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Afri=
ca or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on=
 the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by eve=
ry opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need th=
em most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with a=
ffection, should you never hear from me again.</p>

<p class=3D"letter2"><i>To Mrs. Saville, England.</i></p>
<p class=3D"right">July 7th, 17=E2=80=94.</p>
<p>My dear Sister,</p>
<p>I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe=E2=80=94and well adva=
nced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on i=
ts homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see m=
y native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my =
men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of =
ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards =
which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a ve=
ry high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm =
as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those sho=

<p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a let=

<p class=3D"letter2"><i>To Mrs. Saville, England.</i></p>
<p class=3D"right">August 5th, 17=E2=80=94.</p>
<p>So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recordin=
g it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers=
 can come into your possession.</p>
<p>Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed i=
n the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she flo=
ated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed=
 round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change =
would take place in the atmosphere and weather.</p>
<p>About two o=E2=80=99clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretche=
d out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to=
 have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow wa=
tchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our a=
ttention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a=
 low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the nor=
th, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, b=
ut apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. W=
e watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he =
was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.</p>
<p>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,=
 many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote tha=
t it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, =
by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with t=
he greatest attention.</p>
<p>About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and befor=
e night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the mor=
ning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float=
 about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest fo=
r a few hours.</p>
<p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and f=
ound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to =
someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before=
, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice. Onl=
y one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sa=
ilors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other travell=
er seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a Eur=
opean. When I appeared on deck the master said, =E2=80=9CHere is our captai=
n, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a =
foreign accent. =E2=80=9CBefore I come on board your vessel,=E2=80=9D said =
he, =E2=80=9Cwill you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to=
 me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have suppos=
ed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchan=
ged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, =
that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board. =
Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his sa=
fety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen=
, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a=
 man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin, =
but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We accordingly brou=
ght him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with =
brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed si=
gns of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney o=
f the kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, wh=
ich restored him wonderfully.</p>
<p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often =
feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had i=
n some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him=
 as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: =
his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but th=
ere are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or =
does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up=
, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equ=
alled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnas=
hes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p=
>
<p>When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the=
 men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him=
 to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose=
 restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieu=
tenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.</=
p>
<p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he=
 replied, =E2=80=9CTo seek one who fled from me.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAnd did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYes.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThen I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you=
 up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>This aroused the stranger=E2=80=99s attention, and he asked a multitude =
of questions concerning the route which the d=C3=A6mon, as he called him, h=
ad pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, =E2=80=9CI have=
, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; =
but you are too considerate to make inquiries.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CCertainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in m=
e to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAnd yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; y=
ou have benevolently restored me to life.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice=
 had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any=
 degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and t=
he traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but =
of this I could not judge.</p>
<p>From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the s=
tranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for =
the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in=
 the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere=
. I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant no=
tice if any new object should appear in sight.</p>
<p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the =
present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very sile=
nt and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. Yet his m=
anners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested i=
n him, although they have had very little communication with him. For my ow=
n part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief f=
ills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in=
 his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.</p>
<p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no fri=
end on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had be=
en broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brot=
her of my heart.</p>
<p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should=
 I have any fresh incidents to record.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class=3D"right">August 13th, 17=E2=80=94.</p>
<p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my adm=
iration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a crea=
ture destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so =
gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, althoug=
h his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity a=
nd unparalleled eloquence.</p>
<p>He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck=
, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although u=
nhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interes=
ts himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed wi=
th me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entere=
d attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and in=
to every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easi=
ly led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to=
 give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the f=
ervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existenc=
e, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man=E2=80=99s li=
fe or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowle=
dge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the=
 elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listen=
er=E2=80=99s countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress hi=
s emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and f=
ailed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan b=
urst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accen=
ts: =E2=80=9CUnhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of t=
he intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash =
the cup from your lips!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paro=
xysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, an=
d many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore =
his composure.</p>
<p>Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise hi=
mself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of desp=
air, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me =
the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it awakened=
 various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of=
 my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fa=
llen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of littl=
e happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI agree with you,=E2=80=9D replied the stranger; =E2=80=9Cwe ar=
e unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer tha=
n ourselves=E2=80=94such a friend ought to be=E2=80=94do not lend his aid t=
o perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most =
noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting f=
riendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for d=
espair. But I=E2=80=94I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled gri=
ef that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently retired to=
 his cabin.</p>
<p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does=
 the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded =
by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his so=
ul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and =
be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he=
 will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose c=
ircle no grief or folly ventures.</p>
<p>Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wander=
er? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and refined by book=
s and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious;=
 but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary mer=
its of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what qu=
ality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any =
other person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a qu=
ick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of t=
hings, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of ex=
pression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class=3D"right">August 19th, 17=E2=80=94.</p>
<p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, =E2=80=9CYou may easily perceive, Cap=
tain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had=
 determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, =
but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and w=
isdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wi=
shes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know tha=
t the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect t=
hat you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers=
 which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt mor=
al from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking=
 and console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which a=
re usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I mi=
ght fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things=
 will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would prov=
oke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of natur=
e; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence=
 of the truth of the events of which it is composed.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communic=
ation, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital o=
f his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narra=
tive, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate h=
is fate if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer.</p=
>
<p>=E2=80=9CI thank you,=E2=80=9D he replied, =E2=80=9Cfor your sympathy, b=
ut it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, an=
d then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,=E2=80=9D continu=
ed he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; =E2=80=9Cbut you are mist=
aken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter m=
y destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it i=
s determined.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I=
 should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have=
 resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to=
 record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during=
 the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscri=
pt will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him=
, and who hear it from his own lips=E2=80=94with what interest and sympathy=
 shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my task, his f=
ull-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all t=
heir melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while t=
he lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and ha=
rrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant v=
essel on its course and wrecked it=E2=80=94thus!</p>

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap01"></a>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished=
 of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syn=
dics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and re=
putation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefa=
tigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetuall=
y occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had pr=
evented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he be=
came a husband and the father of a family.</p>
<p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot =
refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant=
 who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into pov=
erty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending dispo=
sition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same count=
ry where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. =
Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreat=
ed with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in =
wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was d=
eeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterl=
y deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little wort=
hy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to se=
ek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again throug=
h his credit and assistance.</p>
<p>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten=
 months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,=
 he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reu=
ss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort ha=
d saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but i=
t was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the=
 meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant=E2=
=80=99s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief=
 only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and=
 at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months=
 he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>
<p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with=
 despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was n=
o other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an u=
ncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She pr=
ocured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn=
 a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p>
<p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time wa=
s more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreas=
ed; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orph=
an and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort=E2=
=80=99s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He cam=
e like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his c=
are; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and p=
laced her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Ca=
roline became his wife.</p>
<p>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but =
this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affe=
ction. There was a sense of justice in my father=E2=80=99s upright mind whi=
ch rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Pe=
rhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthi=
ness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried wor=
th. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mothe=
r, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by=
 reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree,=
 recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpress=
ible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wis=
hes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is shel=
tered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all=
 that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent m=
ind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,=
 had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that ha=
d elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished a=
ll his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the =
pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant o=
n a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened fr=
ame.</p>
<p>From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was b=
orn at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remain=
ed for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each o=
ther, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very min=
e of love to bestow them upon me. My mother=E2=80=99s tender caresses and m=
y father=E2=80=99s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my f=
irst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something bet=
ter=E2=80=94their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on the=
m by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their=
 hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their =
duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards t=
he being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tender=
ness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of=
 my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-co=
ntrol, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of en=
joyment to me.</p>
<p>For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to hav=
e a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five=
 years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they p=
assed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent dispositio=
n often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was m=
ore than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion=E2=80=94remembering what she=
 had suffered, and how she had been relieved=E2=80=94for her to act in her =
turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor =
cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly di=
sconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spo=
ke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himsel=
f to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a p=
easant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributi=
ng a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attr=
acted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. =
The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin =
and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the pove=
rty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her =
brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the mou=
lding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none coul=
d behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heave=
n-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.</p>
<p>The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and ad=
miration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not=
 her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a Germa=
n and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these g=
ood people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long marr=
ied, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their charge w=
as one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy=
=E2=80=94one among the <i>schiavi ognor frementi,</i> who exerted himself t=
o obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its weakness. =
Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not kn=
own. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar.=
 She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fai=
rer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.</p>
<p>When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall=
 of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub=E2=80=94a creature who se=
emed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighte=
r than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With hi=
s permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their cha=
rge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a b=
lessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and w=
ant when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted t=
heir village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the i=
nmate of my parents=E2=80=99 house=E2=80=94my more than sister=E2=80=94the =
beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.</p>
<p>Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachme=
nt with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my d=
elight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother =
had said playfully, =E2=80=9CI have a pretty present for my Victor=E2=80=94=
tomorrow he shall have it.=E2=80=9D And when, on the morrow, she presented =
Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpr=
eted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine=E2=80=94mine to =
protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her I received as made =
to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of c=
ousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in whic=
h she stood to me=E2=80=94my more than sister, since till death she was to =
be mine only.</p>

<p>We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in ou=
r ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or=
 dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and =
contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabet=
h was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardou=
r, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten =
with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial=
 creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surr=
ounded our Swiss home =E2=80=94the sublime shapes of the mountains, the cha=
nges of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life =
and turbulence of our Alpine summers=E2=80=94she found ample scope for admi=
ration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and sati=
sfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investig=
ating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.=
 Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness a=
kin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensati=
ons I can remember.</p>
<p>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave =
up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native count=
ry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a <i>campagne</i> on Belrive, the e=
astern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from=
 the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parent=
s were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd =
and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to m=
y school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closes=
t friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of =
Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, har=
dship, and even danger for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chi=
valry and romance. He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale =
of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to=
 enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes=
 of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous tra=
in who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the =
infidels.</p>
<p>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My par=
ents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt =
that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, =
but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When=
 I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortun=
ate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.</p>
<p>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some l=
aw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to =
an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I c=
onfess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments=
, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was t=
he secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was =
the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the myste=
rious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the=
 metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.<=
/p>
<p>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relation=
s of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions=
 of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among =
those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous bene=
factors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-d=
edicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her s=
oft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless=
 and animate us. She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I=
 might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my natur=
e, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness=
. And Clerval=E2=80=94could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerv=
al? Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his ge=
nerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventu=
rous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficenc=
e and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.</p>
<p>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,=
 before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of ex=
tensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, i=
n drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which le=
d, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would accoun=
t to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny=
 I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten =
sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its=
 course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.</p>
<p>Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, t=
herefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilect=
ion for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a par=
ty of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obli=
ged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find=
 a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the t=
heory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he rel=
ates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn =
upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my fath=
er. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, =E2=
=80=9CAh! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon th=
is; it is sad trash.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to =
me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a mod=
ern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powe=
rs than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, whil=
e those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I s=
hould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination=
, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. =
It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received th=
e fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had t=
aken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its co=
ntents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.</p>
<p>When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of thi=
s author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and stud=
ied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me tre=
asures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always havin=
g been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In=
 spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophe=
rs, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac N=
ewton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells be=
side the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in ea=
ch branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to=
 my boy=E2=80=99s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.</p>
<p>The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted w=
ith their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He=
 had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments wer=
e still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names=
; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiar=
y grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications a=
nd impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel o=
f nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.</p>
<p>But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and kne=
w more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their dis=
ciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth centu=
ry; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva,=
 I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies.=
 My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child=E2=
=80=99s blindness, added to a student=E2=80=99s thirst for knowledge. Under=
 the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence in=
to the search of the philosopher=E2=80=99s stone and the elixir of life; bu=
t the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior o=
bject, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease =
from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death=
!</p>
<p>Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a pr=
omise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I=
 most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I at=
tributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a wa=
nt of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupi=
ed by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory=
 theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious know=
ledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an acci=
dent again changed the current of my ideas.</p>
<p>When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belr=
ive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advance=
d from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with fri=
ghtful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the=
 storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood=
 at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and b=
eautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as =
the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained =
but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree=
 shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but en=
tirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly =
destroyed.</p>
<p>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electri=
city. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was wi=
th us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a =
theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, whi=
ch was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly in=
to the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords =
of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disincli=
ned me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would=
 or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly=
 grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps=
 most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, s=
et down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive crea=
tion, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which cou=
ld never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this mood of =
mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertain=
ing to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy o=
f my consideration.</p>
<p>Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments a=
re we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if t=
his almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate sugg=
estion of the guardian angel of my life=E2=80=94the last effort made by the=
 spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in th=
e stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tr=
anquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my anci=
ent and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to=
 associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.</p>
<p>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual. De=
stiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terri=
ble destruction.</p>

<a id=3D"chap03"></a>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I shou=
ld become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attende=
d the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the complet=
ion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs tha=
n those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early =
date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune o=
f my life occurred=E2=80=94an omen, as it were, of my future misery.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she =
was in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urge=
d to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at firs=
t yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favour=
ite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her =
sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distem=
per=E2=80=94Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence we=
re fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever w=
as accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical =
attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her deathbed the fortitude an=
d benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands =
of Elizabeth and myself. =E2=80=9CMy children,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9C=
my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your un=
ion. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth=
, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children. Alas! I regret =
that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not =
hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endea=
vour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meetin=
g you in another world.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. =
I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by th=
at most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and th=
e despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mi=
nd can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existe=
nce appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever=E2=80=94that the =
brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a v=
oice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard.=
 These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time pr=
oves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences=
. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And =
why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time=
 at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and=
 the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege,=
 is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ough=
t to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think =
ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.</p>
<p>My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, wa=
s now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some we=
eks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death=
, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to=
 sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sigh=
t of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet El=
izabeth in some degree consoled.</p>
<p>She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. S=
he looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. Sh=
e devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and c=
ousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the =
sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regr=
et in her endeavours to make us forget.</p>
<p>The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evenin=
g with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accom=
pany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His father was a narr=
ow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition =
of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liber=
al education. He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye =
and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained =
to the miserable details of commerce.</p>
<p>We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persua=
de ourselves to say the word =E2=80=9CFarewell!=E2=80=9D It was said, and w=
e retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the othe=
r was deceived; but when at morning=E2=80=99s dawn I descended to the carri=
age which was to convey me away, they were all there=E2=80=94my father agai=
n to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew he=
r entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine atten=
tions on her playmate and friend.</p>
<p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged i=
n the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiab=
le companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasur=
e=E2=80=94I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I must for=
m my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarka=
bly secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to n=
ew countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were =
=E2=80=9Cold familiar faces,=E2=80=9D but I believed myself totally unfitte=
d for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my =
journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired =
the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to=
 remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the =
world and take my station among other human beings. Now my desires were com=
plied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.</p>
<p>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my =
journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high whi=
te steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my soli=
tary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.</p>
<p>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit=
 to some of the principal professors. Chance=E2=80=94or rather the evil inf=
luence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me fr=
om the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father=E2=80=99s door=E2=
=80=94led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He was an=
 uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He asked me =
several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of scien=
ce appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in =
contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I h=
ad studied. The professor stared. =E2=80=9CHave you,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=
=80=9Creally spent your time in studying such nonsense?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I replied in the affirmative. =E2=80=9CEvery minute,=E2=80=9D continued =
M. Krempe with warmth, =E2=80=9Cevery instant that you have wasted on those=
 books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exp=
loded systems and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you liv=
ed, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you=
 have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are=
 ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to fin=
d a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin=
 your studies entirely anew.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treat=
ing of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me =
after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to=
 commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relat=
ions, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry=
 the alternate days that he omitted.</p>
<p>I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long consid=
ered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned no=
t at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Kremp=
e was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; th=
e teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In r=
ather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an =
account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years.=
 As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern =
professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be account=
ed for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had re=
trod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the disco=
veries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides,=
 I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very di=
fferent when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such =
views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed. The ambi=
tion of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those vi=
sions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required t=
o exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.</p=
>
<p>Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my reside=
nce at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the=
 localities and the principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing=
 week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me =
concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear th=
at little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected=
 what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto =
been out of town.</p>
<p>Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturin=
g room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unl=
ike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect=
 expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his templ=
es, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person was sho=
rt but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He beg=
an his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the vari=
ous improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervou=
r the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory v=
iew of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementar=
y terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with=
 a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget=
:</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe ancient teachers of this science,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=
=9Cpromised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promi=
se very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the eli=
xir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made=
 to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible,=
 have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature=
 and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the heavens;=
 they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air w=
e breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can com=
mand the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisi=
ble world with its own shadows.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Such were the professor=E2=80=99s words=E2=80=94rather let me say such t=
he words of the fate=E2=80=94enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt a=
s if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various k=
eys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord =
was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, =
one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein=E2=
=80=94more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked,=
 I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world =
the deepest mysteries of creation.</p>
<p>I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of ins=
urrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no p=
ower to produce it. By degrees, after the morning=E2=80=99s dawn, sleep cam=
e. I awoke, and my yesternight=E2=80=99s thoughts were as a dream. There on=
ly remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myse=
lf to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On=
 the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners in private were even m=
ore mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in =
his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the grea=
test affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of =
my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor. He heard with at=
tention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names =
of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Kremp=
e had exhibited. He said that =E2=80=9CThese were men to whose indefatigabl=
e zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of the=
ir knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and=
 arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degre=
e had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of geni=
us, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning =
to the solid advantage of mankind.=E2=80=9D I listened to his statement, wh=
ich was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added th=
at his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I express=
ed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a yout=
h to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would hav=
e made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labou=
rs. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI am happy,=E2=80=9D said M. Waldman, =E2=80=9Cto have gained a=
 disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of =
your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the g=
reatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that =
I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglecte=
d the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist =
if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is=
 to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, =
I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, includi=
ng mathematics.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his =
various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promisin=
g me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the scien=
ce not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which =
I had requested, and I took my leave.</p>
<p>Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.</p>

<a id=3D"chap04"></a>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the mos=
t comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read=
 with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which moder=
n inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures and cul=
tivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I fou=
nd even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, comb=
ined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that=
 account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentle=
ness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an=
 air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In =
a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most =
abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was =
at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and s=
oon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the ligh=
t of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</p>
<p>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was=
 rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my profi=
ciency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smi=
le, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most hea=
rtfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during w=
hich I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pur=
suit of some discoveries which I hoped to make. None but those who have exp=
erienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. In other studies =
you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to =
know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and=
 wonder. A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must i=
nfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually=
 sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up i=
n this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discov=
eries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me gr=
eat esteem and admiration at the university. When I had arrived at this poi=
nt and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natura=
l philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolst=
adt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I tho=
ught of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happen=
ed that protracted my stay.</p>
<p>One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the=
 structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Wh=
ence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bol=
d question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with h=
ow many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice o=
r carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstanc=
es in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly =
to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless =
I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to=
 this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the =
causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted w=
ith the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observ=
e the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my fa=
ther had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed wi=
th no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a ta=
le of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness h=
ad no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacl=
e of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and stre=
ngth, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and =
progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and ch=
arnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportab=
le to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man wa=
s degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the bloo=
ming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and=
 brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as=
 exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until fro=
m the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me=E2=80=94a ligh=
t so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with =
the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that am=
ong so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same=
 science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secr=
et.</p>
<p>Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not mo=
re certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true. Som=
e miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were dist=
inct and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, =
I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I b=
ecame myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.</p>
<p>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon=
 gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful lab=
our, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying =
consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming =
that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliter=
ated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of t=
he wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not =
that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I =
had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I sh=
ould point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object=
 already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the =
dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingl=
y ineffectual light.</p>
<p>I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express,=
 my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am ac=
quainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and y=
ou will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lea=
d you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infal=
lible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example,=
 how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that ma=
n is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to b=
ecome greater than his nature will allow.</p>
<p>When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated =
a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I p=
ossessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for th=
e reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, =
still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at =
first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one =
of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my firs=
t success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as =
complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command ha=
rdly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that=
 I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses=
; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperf=
ect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in s=
cience and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at=
 least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magn=
itude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It=
 was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the=
 minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, =
contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, th=
at is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After h=
aving formed this determination and having spent some months in successfull=
y collecting and arranging my materials, I began.</p>
<p>No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like =
a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to=
 me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of=
 light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and=
 source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No f=
ather could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should dese=
rve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow an=
imation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now fo=
und it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body t=
o corruption.</p>
<p>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with=
 unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had =
become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certaint=
y, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next h=
our might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which=
 I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, =
with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-pla=
ces. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among th=
e unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate th=
e lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembranc=
e; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I see=
med to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was ind=
eed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so =
soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my ol=
d habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane=
 fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber,=
 or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other =
apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creatio=
n; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details=
 of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished ma=
ny of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from m=
y occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually incr=
eased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.</p>
<p>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in on=
e pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a mo=
re plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my ey=
es were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which mad=
e me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends wh=
o were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I =
knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my fath=
er: =E2=80=9CI know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think=
 of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardo=
n me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that yo=
ur other duties are equally neglected.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I knew well therefore what would be my father=E2=80=99s feelings, but I =
could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but whi=
ch had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, =
to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the gre=
at object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed=
.</p>
<p>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect =
to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justif=
ied in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human =
being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and n=
ever to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I=
 do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. I=
f the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affec=
tions and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no allo=
y can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, =
not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man =
allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his do=
mestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, C=C3=A6sar would have spar=
ed his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the =
empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.</p>
<p>But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tal=
e, and your looks remind me to proceed.</p>
<p>My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my sil=
ence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. Winter=
, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the=
 blossom or the expanding leaves=E2=80=94sights which before always yielded=
 me supreme delight=E2=80=94so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The=
 leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and =
now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthu=
siasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by s=
lavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist =
occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow=
 fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf s=
tartled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a =
crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become;=
 the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, an=
d I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient di=
sease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be compl=
ete.</p>

<div class=3D"chapter">
<h2>
<a id=3D"chap05"></a>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of=
 my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the i=
nstruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the=
 lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the=
 rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt o=
ut, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yel=
low eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agi=
tated its limbs.</p>
<p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the=
 wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? H=
is limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. =
Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles =
and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his te=
eth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid =
contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the=
 dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and st=
raight black lips.</p>
<p>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of=
 human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose=
 of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of=
 rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderat=
ion; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and bre=
athless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of =
the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time=
 traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length l=
assitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself o=
n the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulnes=
s. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest =
dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the s=
treets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imp=
rinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death;=
 her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of m=
y dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-=
worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with ho=
rror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb be=
came convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced=
 its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch=E2=80=94the miser=
able monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his=
 eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and h=
e muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He m=
ight have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly=
 to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the co=
urtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during t=
he rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listen=
ing attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce =
the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given lif=
e.</p>
<p>Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy agai=
n endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed=
 on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and join=
ts were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante co=
uld not have conceived.</p>
<p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and ha=
rdly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank =
to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horro=
r, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food an=
d pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the c=
hange was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!</p>
<p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless=
 and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, whi=
ch indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, whic=
h had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them=
 with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every t=
urning of the street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the=
 apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenc=
hed by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.</p>
<p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily=
 exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the stree=
ts without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. My hear=
t palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps=
, not daring to look about me:</p>
<p class=3D"poem">Like one who, on a lonely road,<br>
Doth walk in fear and dread,<br>
And, having once turned round, walks on,<br>
And turns no more his head;<br>
Because he knows a frightful fiend<br>
Doth close behind him tread.<br>
<br>
[Coleridge=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CAncient Mariner.=E2=80=9D]<br></p>
<p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the vario=
us diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;=
 but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming =
towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed t=
hat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and o=
n the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, inst=
antly sprung out. =E2=80=9CMy dear Frankenstein,=E2=80=9D exclaimed he, =E2=
=80=9Chow glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at th=
e very moment of my alighting!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought b=
ack to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so de=
ar to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror=
 and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months=
, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial=
 manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for so=
me time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitte=
d to come to Ingolstadt. =E2=80=9CYou may easily believe,=E2=80=9D said he,=
 =E2=80=9Chow great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all neces=
sary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, ind=
eed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer =
to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster i=
n The Vicar of Wakefield: =E2=80=98I have ten thousand florins a year witho=
ut Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.=E2=80=99 But his affection for me a=
t length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to under=
take a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how yo=
u left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CVery well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear =
from you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their ac=
count myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,=E2=80=9D continued he, stopping sh=
ort and gazing full in my face, =E2=80=9CI did not before remark how very i=
ll you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for s=
everal nights.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in=
 one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;=
 but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end=
 and that I am at length free.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to =
allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pa=
ce, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought ma=
de me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still=
 be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I=
 feared still more that Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to=
 remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my o=
wn room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected m=
yself. I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door f=
orcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre t=
o stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I step=
ped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed fr=
om its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune c=
ould have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed f=
led, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.</p>
<p>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; b=
ut I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I=
 felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapid=
ly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped=
 over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first att=
ributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me m=
ore attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not accoun=
t, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished =
him.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy dear Victor,=E2=80=9D cried he, =E2=80=9Cwhat, for God=E2=80=
=99s sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! Wha=
t is the cause of all this?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDo not ask me,=E2=80=9D cried I, putting my hands before my eye=
s, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; =E2=80=9C<i=
>he</i> can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!=E2=80=9D I imagined that the monste=
r seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.</p>
<p>Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anti=
cipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not the=
 witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for=
 a long, long time.</p>
<p>This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for sever=
al months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learn=
ed that, knowing my father=E2=80=99s advanced age and unfitness for so long=
 a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared th=
em this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could=
 not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the ho=
pe he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he=
 performed the kindest action that he could towards them.</p>
<p>But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and =
unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The for=
m of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my ey=
es, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised He=
nry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagina=
tion, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same sub=
ject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon=
 and terrible event.</p>
<p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieve=
d my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of obs=
erving outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fall=
en leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from =
the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season con=
tributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and aff=
ection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I beca=
me as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDearest Clerval,=E2=80=9D exclaimed I, =E2=80=9Chow kind, how v=
ery good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study,=
 as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I e=
ver repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which =
I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, b=
ut get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, =
I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object =
on whom I dared not even think?</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CCompose yourself,=E2=80=9D said Clerval, who observed my change=
 of colour, =E2=80=9CI will not mention it if it agitates you; but your fat=
her and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in yo=
ur own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy a=
t your long silence.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIs that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first=
 thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who=
 are so deserving of my love?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIf this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be =
glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from=
 your cousin, I believe.=E2=80=9D</p>
</div>

<div class=3D"chapter">

<a id=3D"chap06"></a>Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own =
Elizabeth:</p>
<p class=3D"letter">=E2=80=9CMy dearest Cousin,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of d=
ear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are f=
orbidden to write=E2=80=94to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor=
, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought th=
at each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my u=
ncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encount=
ering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how =
often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself! I figure to mys=
elf that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercena=
ry old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with t=
he care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval wr=
ites that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confi=
rm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CGet well=E2=80=94and return to us. You will find a happy, cheer=
ful home and friends who love you dearly. Your father=E2=80=99s health is v=
igorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; a=
nd not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you w=
ould be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full=
 of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter int=
o foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder br=
other returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military ca=
reer in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application.=
 He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air=
, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an i=
dler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession wh=
ich he has selected.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CLittle alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has =
taken place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains=E2=80=
=94they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts =
are regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up m=
y time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but=
 happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has taken p=
lace in our little household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Mori=
tz entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate her history, ther=
efore in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four chil=
dren, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourit=
e of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not end=
ure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt ob=
served this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mot=
her to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our c=
ountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail i=
n the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction be=
tween the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being n=
either so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A=
 servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and =
England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a serv=
ant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea=
 of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CJustine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and =
I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance=
 from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives co=
ncerning the beauty of Angelica=E2=80=94she looked so frank-hearted and hap=
py. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced =
to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. =
This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creatur=
e in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard o=
ne pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her =
protectress. Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsid=
erate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She=
 thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phr=
aseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in th=
eir own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illne=
ss with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other tr=
ials were reserved for her.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COne by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with =
the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience=
 of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favou=
rites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Rom=
an Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had c=
onceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Ju=
stine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she=
 quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief =
had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before =
been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother=E2=80=99s=
 house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillati=
ng in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindnes=
s, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers=
 and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a declin=
e, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for e=
ver. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of th=
is last winter. Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love he=
r tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I menti=
oned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear a=
unt.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little d=
arling William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with =
sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he smiles,=
 two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He ha=
s already had one or two little <i>wives,</i> but Louisa Biron is his favou=
rite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CNow, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a littl=
e gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield ha=
s already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage wi=
th a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married=
 M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, L=
ouis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerva=
l from Geneva. But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to=
 be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.=
 She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, =
and a favourite with everybody.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my =
anxiety returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,=E2=80=94one l=
ine=E2=80=94one word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry=
 for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely gr=
ateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write!=

<p>=E2=80=9CDear, dear Elizabeth!=E2=80=9D I exclaimed, when I had read her=
 letter: =E2=80=9CI will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety =
they must feel.=E2=80=9D I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; bu=
t my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another fortn=
ight I was able to leave my chamber.</p>
<p>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the se=
veral professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of ro=
ugh usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since =
the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes=
, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosoph=
y. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical i=
nstrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this,=
 and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apar=
tment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which ha=
d previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no=
 avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he =
praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in t=
he sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessin=
g the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the sub=
ject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I eviden=
tly saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tor=
mented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view tho=
se instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and=
 cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I f=
elt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the s=
ensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total i=
gnorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked my frien=
d from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, =
but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him =
with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could =
never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often prese=
nt to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only =
impress more deeply.</p>
<p>M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of a=
lmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even m=
ore pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. =E2=80=9CD=E2=80=94=
n the fellow!=E2=80=9D cried he; =E2=80=9Cwhy, M. Clerval, I assure you he =
has outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.=
 A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as fir=
mly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; an=
d if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.=E2=80=
=94Ay, ay,=E2=80=9D continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering=
, =E2=80=9CM. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. =
Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was my=
self when young; but that wears out in a very short time.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned t=
he conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.</p>
<p>Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his =
literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came=
 to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the=
 oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life h=
e had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he t=
urned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterp=
rise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, an=
d I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been=
 irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my =
former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my frien=
d, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orien=
talists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialect=
s, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary am=
usement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my=
 labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degre=
e I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When yo=
u read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden o=
f roses,=E2=80=94in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire tha=
t consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry=
 of Greece and Rome!</p>
<p>Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fix=
ed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, wi=
nter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was=
 retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I =
longed to see my native town and my beloved friends. My return had only bee=
n delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange plac=
e, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter,=
 however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late=
, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.</p>
<p>The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily =
which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian=
 tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell t=
o the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this prop=
osition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite c=
ompanion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of =
my native country.</p>
<p>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had=
 long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubriou=
s air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversati=
on of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fe=
llow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the bett=
er feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, a=
nd the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you did =
love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your=
 own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness =
and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature=
 who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. Whe=
n happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delight=
ful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The=
 present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hed=
ges, while those of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by though=
ts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my =
endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.</p>
<p>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: h=
e exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that fille=
d his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishi=
ng: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation =
of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and=
 passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out int=
o arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.</p>
<p>We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were danc=
ing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high,=
 and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.</p>

<a id=3D"chap07"></a>Chapter 7</h2>
<p>On my return, I found the following letter from my father:=E2=80=94</p>
<p class=3D"letter">=E2=80=9CMy dear Victor,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the da=
te of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lin=
es, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would =
be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my =
son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary=
, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Abs=
ence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall=
 I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful=
 news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page t=
o seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWilliam is dead!=E2=80=94that sweet child, whose smiles delight=
ed and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murder=
ed!</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the c=
ircumstances of the transaction.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CLast Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, we=
nt to walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonge=
d our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of ret=
urning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on bef=
ore, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they shoul=
d return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; h=
e said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hid=
e himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a l=
ong time, but that he did not return.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for =
him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returne=
d to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I co=
uld not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was ex=
posed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme a=
nguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the nigh=
t before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass l=
ivid and motionless; the print of the murder=E2=80=99s finger was on his ne=
ck.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHe was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my co=
untenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the=
 corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and enterin=
g the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasp=
ing her hands exclaimed, =E2=80=98O God! I have murdered my darling child!=
=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CShe fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she=
 again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same eve=
ning William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that =
she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the t=
emptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at =
present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they wi=
ll not restore my beloved William!</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CCome, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weep=
s continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her =
words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an addition=
al motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother=
! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel,=
 miserable death of her youngest darling!</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CCome, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the as=
sassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead =
of festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my frie=
nd, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with ha=
tred for your enemies.</p>

<p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surpr=
ised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on =
receiving new from my friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered=
 my face with my hands.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy dear Frankenstein,=E2=80=9D exclaimed Henry, when he perceiv=
ed me weep with bitterness, =E2=80=9Care you always to be unhappy? My dear =
friend, what has happened?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the roo=
m in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, a=
s he read the account of my misfortune.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI can offer you no consolation, my friend,=E2=80=9D said he; =
=E2=80=9Cyour disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?=E2=80=9D</=
p>
<p>=E2=80=9CTo go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the ho=
rses.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; =
he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. =E2=80=9CPoor William!=E2=80=
=9D said he, =E2=80=9Cdear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mothe=
r! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must we=
ep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer=E2=80=
=99s grasp! How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! =
Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and wee=
p, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ev=
er. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be=
 a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impresse=
d themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But n=
ow, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade far=
ewell to my friend.</p>
<p>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I lon=
ged to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when=
 I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustai=
n the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through sce=
nes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. Ho=
w altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating =
change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by d=
egrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranqu=
illy, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance,=
 dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was un=
able to define them.</p>
<p>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contem=
plated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy=
 mountains, =E2=80=9Cthe palaces of nature,=E2=80=9D were not changed. By d=
egrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey =
towards Geneva.</p>
<p>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approac=
hed my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, a=
nd the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. =E2=80=9CDear moun=
tains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summit=
s are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate=
 peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on the=
se preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, =
and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but =
a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mo=
untains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!</p>
<p>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also=
 closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt stil=
l more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I f=
oresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human b=
eings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance=
, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hun=
dredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.</p>
<p>It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gat=
es of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Se=
cheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky w=
as serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where=
 my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I=
 was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During t=
his short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in=
 the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, o=
n landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It adv=
anced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in =
large drops, but its violence quickly increased.</p>
<p>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increa=
sed every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.=
 It was echoed from Sal=C3=AAve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid fl=
ashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear=
 like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pit=
chy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The =
storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various par=
ts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, o=
ver the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and t=
he village of Cop=C3=AAt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes=
; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the M=C3=B4le, a peaked moun=
tain to the east of the lake.</p>
<p>While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on wi=
th a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped m=
y hands, and exclaimed aloud, =E2=80=9CWilliam, dear angel! this is thy fun=
eral, this thy dirge!=E2=80=9D As I said these words, I perceived in the gl=
oom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixe=
d, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminat=
ed the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature=
, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, in=
stantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy d=C3=A6mon, to whom =
I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the concep=
tion) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imaginat=
ion, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was fo=
rced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and =
I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fai=
r child. <i>He</i> was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presenc=
e of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing =
the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him=
 to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont S=
al=C3=AAve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached th=
e summit, and disappeared.</p>
<p>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued,=
 and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my =
mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of =
my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hand=
s at my bedside; its departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the =
night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! =
I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in c=
arnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?</p>
<p>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the n=
ight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the =
inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and=
 despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed=
 with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed whi=
ch he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit le=
t loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.</p>
<p>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were ope=
n, and I hastened to my father=E2=80=99s house. My first thought was to dis=
cover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. Bu=
t I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I=
 myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the =
precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever=
 with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, an=
d which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improb=
able. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me,=
 I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the stra=
nge nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far cre=
dited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use woul=
d be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhangin=
g sides of Mont Sal=C3=AAve? These reflections determined me, and I resolve=
d to remain silent.</p>
<p>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father=E2=80=99s hous=
e. I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library=
 to attend their usual hour of rising.</p>
<p>Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, an=
d I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my d=
eparture for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to=
 me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece=
. It was an historical subject, painted at my father=E2=80=99s desire, and =
represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffi=
n of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there wa=
s an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity=
. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I=
 looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me =
arrive, and hastened to welcome me: =E2=80=9CWelcome, my dearest Victor,=E2=
=80=9D said he. =E2=80=9CAh! I wish you had come three months ago, and then=
 you would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to sh=
are a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, r=
evive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasi=
ons will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusa=
tions.=E2=80=94Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother=E2=80=99s eyes; a sense of mor=
tal agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness=
 of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terr=
ible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning=
 my father, and here I named my cousin.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CShe most of all,=E2=80=9D said Ernest, =E2=80=9Crequires consol=
ation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and th=
at made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered=E2=80=
=94=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could a=
ttempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake t=
he winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was =
free last night!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI do not know what you mean,=E2=80=9D replied my brother, in ac=
cents of wonder, =E2=80=9Cbut to us the discovery we have made completes ou=
r misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not=
 be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit t=
hat Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could s=
uddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?=E2=80=9D</=
p>
<p>=E2=80=9CJustine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is =
wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?=E2=80=
=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CNo one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that h=
ave almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so con=
fused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no =
hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William ha=
d been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for =
several days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to exami=
ne the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in h=
er pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptat=
ion of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, =
who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and,=
 upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the =
fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extre=
me confusion of manner.</p>
<p>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied ea=
rnestly, =E2=80=9CYou are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,=
 good Justine, is innocent.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on=
 his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after w=
e had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other top=
ic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, =E2=80=9CGood God, =
papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe do also, unfortunately,=E2=80=9D replied my father, =E2=80=
=9Cfor indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered=
 so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.=E2=80=9D=
</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIf she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is =
to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted=
.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justin=
e, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fea=
r, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward str=
ong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its as=
tounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one =
indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses c=
onvinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and ra=
sh ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?</p>
<p>We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last behe=
ld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her chi=
ldish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was alli=
ed to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect. She welcomed me=
 with the greatest affection. =E2=80=9CYour arrival, my dear cousin,=E2=80=
=9D said she, =E2=80=9Cfills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means=
 to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convict=
ed of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our =
misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling =
boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even =
a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she wil=
l not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after =
the sad death of my little William.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CShe is innocent, my Elizabeth,=E2=80=9D said I, =E2=80=9Cand th=
at shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the as=
surance of her acquittal.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHow kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her g=
uilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to =
see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless an=
d despairing.=E2=80=9D She wept.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDearest niece,=E2=80=9D said my father, =E2=80=9Cdry your tears=
. If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and=
 the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality=

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap08"></a>Chapter 8</h2>
<p>We passed a few sad hours until eleven o=E2=80=99clock, when the trial w=
as to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to atten=
d as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this w=
retched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided =
whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the deat=
h of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy,=
 the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy t=
hat could make the murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of m=
erit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now a=
ll was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousa=
nd times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed =
to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration =
would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have ex=
culpated her who suffered through me.</p>
<p>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and her=
 countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelin=
gs, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did =
not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kind=
ness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the m=
inds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed =
to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently con=
strained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her gu=
ilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered t=
he court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were s=
eated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recove=
red herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter g=
uiltlessness.</p>
<p>The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charg=
e, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against he=
r, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocenc=
e as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had=
 been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman no=
t far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterward=
s found. The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strang=
ely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to=
 the house about eight o=E2=80=99clock, and when one inquired where she had=
 passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and =
demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown th=
e body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. =
The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; an=
d when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, =
an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a =
murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.</p>
<p>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her c=
ountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expresse=
d. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plea=
d, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice=
.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CGod knows,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Chow entirely I am innoce=
nt. But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my =
innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been ad=
duced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline=
 my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears do=
ubtful or suspicious.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed th=
e evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house =
of an aunt at Ch=C3=AAne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva.=
 On her return, at about nine o=E2=80=99clock, she met a man who asked her =
if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was alarmed by this=
 account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Gen=
eva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a=
 barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, t=
o whom she was well known. Most of the night she spent here watching; towar=
ds morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps distur=
bed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she m=
ight again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot wher=
e his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered =
when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passe=
d a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concern=
ing the picture she could give no account.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI know,=E2=80=9D continued the unhappy victim, =E2=80=9Chow hea=
vily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no pow=
er of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am onl=
y left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have be=
en placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have n=
o enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy m=
e wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity affor=
ded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to=
 part with it again so soon?</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no roo=
m for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my=
 character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I=
 must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they=
 spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed=
 her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth=
 saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable=
 conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she=
 desired permission to address the court.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI am,=E2=80=9D said she, =E2=80=9Cthe cousin of the unhappy chi=
ld who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have l=
ived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may the=
refore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when =
I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her preten=
ded friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of h=
er character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the sa=
me house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years=
. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent=
 of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last i=
llness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her ow=
n mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration =
of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle=E2=80=99s hous=
e, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the =
child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother=
. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the e=
vidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. =
She had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chi=
ef proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly gi=
ven it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth=E2=80=99s simple and powerful=
 appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour=
 of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed vi=
olence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Eli=
zabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extr=
eme during the whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could t=
he d=C3=A6mon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother al=
so in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I=
 could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that th=
e popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my=
 unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the ac=
cused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of =
remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.</p>
<p>I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the=
 court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question=
, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballo=
ts had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.</p>
<p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced =
sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate e=
xpressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair =
that I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justi=
ne had already confessed her guilt. =E2=80=9CThat evidence,=E2=80=9D he obs=
erved, =E2=80=9Cwas hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of =
it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circums=
tantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my=
 eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe=
 me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return =
home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy cousin,=E2=80=9D replied I, =E2=80=9Cit is decided as you ma=
y have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than=
 that one guilty should escape. But she has confessed.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upo=
n Justine=E2=80=99s innocence. =E2=80=9CAlas!=E2=80=9D said she. =E2=80=9CH=
ow shall I ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and =
esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only =
to betray? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet=
 she has committed a murder.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see m=
y cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her ow=
n judgment and feelings to decide. =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said Elizabeth, =
=E2=80=9CI will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompan=
y me; I cannot go alone.=E2=80=9D The idea of this visit was torture to me,=
 yet I could not refuse.</p>
<p>We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some =
straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on h=
er knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her=
, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin w=
ept also.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COh, Justine!=E2=80=9D said she. =E2=80=9CWhy did you rob me of =
my last consolation? I relied on your innocence, and although I was then ve=
ry wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAnd do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you =
also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?=E2=80=
=9D Her voice was suffocated with sobs.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CRise, my poor girl,=E2=80=9D said Elizabeth; =E2=80=9Cwhy do yo=
u kneel, if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you =
guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yours=
elf declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be assured, de=
ar Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but y=
our own confession.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might=
 obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than al=
l my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, =
my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost beg=
an to think that I was the monster that he said I was. He threatened excomm=
unication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate. Dear la=
dy, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignomi=
ny and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; a=
nd now only am I truly miserable.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>She paused, weeping, and then continued, =E2=80=9CI thought with horror,=
 my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aun=
t had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a c=
rime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William!=
 dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shal=
l all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and =
death.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted yo=
u. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will pr=
oclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your e=
nemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die! You, my playfellow, my c=
ompanion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! No! I never could survive =
so horrible a misfortune.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Justine shook her head mournfully. =E2=80=9CI do not fear to die,=E2=80=
=9D she said; =E2=80=9Cthat pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives =
me courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you =
remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to =
the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to th=
e will of heaven!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, w=
here I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dar=
ed talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful b=
oundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter ag=
ony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that cam=
e from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it was, she approa=
ched me and said, =E2=80=9CDear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I =
hope, do not believe that I am guilty?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I could not answer. =E2=80=9CNo, Justine,=E2=80=9D said Elizabeth; =E2=
=80=9Che is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he h=
eard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest g=
ratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affe=
ction of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misf=
ortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is ackn=
owledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed g=
ained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never=
-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Eli=
zabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence=
, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but=
 cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the=
 core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish. =
We stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with great difficulty that=
 Elizabeth could tear herself away. =E2=80=9CI wish,=E2=80=9D cried she, =
=E2=80=9Cthat I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery=
.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repres=
sed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-su=
ppressed emotion, =E2=80=9CFarewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my belo=
ved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may=
 this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer! Live, and be happy,=
 and make others so.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth=E2=80=99s heart-rending eloque=
nce failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminal=
ity of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals were lost =
upon them. And when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfe=
eling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips. Thus=
 I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon =
my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!</p>
<p>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and =
voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father=E2=
=80=99s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the wo=
rk of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not yo=
ur last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of you=
r lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your=
 kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop=
 of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it =
is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with ble=
ssings and spend his life in serving you=E2=80=94he bids you weep, to shed =
countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfi=
ed, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeed=
ed to your sad torments!</p>
<p>Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, =
I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Jus=
tine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.</p>

<a id=3D"chap09"></a>Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have =
been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inacti=
on and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.=
 Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my v=
eins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing=
 could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for=
 I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, m=
uch more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with =
kindness and the love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intention=
s and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make m=
yself useful to my fellow beings. Now all was blasted; instead of that sere=
nity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-sa=
tisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by=
 remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense=
 tortures such as no language can describe.</p>
<p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entire=
ly recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of m=
an; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only=
 consolation=E2=80=94deep, dark, deathlike solitude.</p>
<p>My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my dispositio=
n and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his =
serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awake=
n in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me. =E2=80=
=9CDo you think, Victor,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=9Cthat I do not suffer al=
so? No one could love a child more than I loved your brother=E2=80=9D=E2=80=
=94tears came into his eyes as he spoke=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cbut is it not a du=
ty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappines=
s by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself,=
 for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discha=
rge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.=E2=80=9D<=
/p>
<p>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I shoul=
d have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse ha=
d not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensation=
s. Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour t=
o hide myself from his view.</p>
<p>About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was part=
icularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o=E2=
=80=99clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour =
had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I=
 was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the nigh=
t, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my=
 sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the=
 middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way =
to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace=
 around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene =
so beautiful and heavenly=E2=80=94if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose=
 harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore=
=E2=80=94often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that t=
he waters might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrai=
ned, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly =
loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my fathe=
r and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them exposed a=
nd unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?<=
/p>
<p>At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my =
mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that coul=
d not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalter=
able evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created s=
hould perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was=
 not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its en=
ormity should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was always =
scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind. My abhorrence o=
f this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth,=
 my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life whi=
ch I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and mali=
ce, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made=
 a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have p=
recipitated him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wrea=
k the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of Will=
iam and Justine.</p>
<p>Our house was the house of mourning. My father=E2=80=99s health was deep=
ly shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and despond=
ing; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure s=
eemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thou=
ght was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroy=
ed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered wit=
h me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospec=
ts. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had=
 visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen I reflect, my dear cousin,=E2=80=9D said she, =E2=80=9Con =
the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its wo=
rks as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vi=
ce and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of anci=
ent days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to=
 reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appe=
ar to me as monsters thirsting for each other=E2=80=99s blood. Yet I am cer=
tainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she c=
ould have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would h=
ave been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels=
, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she h=
ad nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own! I=
 could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should =
have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. But she=
 was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion=
, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the t=
ruth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were w=
alking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and=
 endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were assassi=
nated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps=
 respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the =
same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, b=
ut in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my counte=
nance, and kindly taking my hand, said, =E2=80=9CMy dearest friend, you mus=
t calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I=
 am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, and some=
times of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, b=
anish these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, who centre all =
their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy? Ah! Whil=
e we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and =
beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing=E2=80=94wh=
at can disturb our peace?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every othe=
r gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart? =
Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very mo=
ment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.</p>
<p>Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of h=
eaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffec=
tual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could pene=
trate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake=
, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a =
type of me.</p>
<p>Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but =
sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exe=
rcise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. I=
t was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bendi=
ng my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, th=
e eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human=
, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I h=
ad visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then=
: <i>I</i> was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring=
 scenes.</p>
<p>I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hire=
d a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on the=
se rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month=
 of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable ep=
och from which I dated all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly l=
ightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountai=
ns and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river ra=
ging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a p=
ower mighty as Omnipotence=E2=80=94and I ceased to fear or to bend before a=
ny being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, =
here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, t=
he valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined cast=
les hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and co=
ttages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a sce=
ne of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mig=
hty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as =
belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings.</p>
<p>I passed the bridge of P=C3=A9lissier, where the ravine, which the river=
 forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs=
 it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more won=
derful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox,=
 through which I had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its imm=
ediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Imm=
ense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the fall=
ing avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme =
and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding <i>aiguilles=
</i>, and its tremendous <i>d=C3=B4me</i> overlooked the valley.</p>
<p>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this =
journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and reco=
gnised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthear=
ted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and ma=
ternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence ceased =
to act=E2=80=94I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all =
the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forge=
t the world, my fears, and more than all, myself=E2=80=94or, in a more desp=
erate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by ho=
rror and despair.</p>
<p>At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to=
 the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured. For a sh=
ort space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings t=
hat played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which=
 pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby =
to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crep=
t over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.</p>

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap10"></a>Chapter 10</h2>
<p>I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the=
 sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slo=
w pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the vall=
ey. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the =
glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the s=
olemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was brok=
en only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunde=
r sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains,=
 of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable law=
s, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in th=
eir hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest co=
nsolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all little=
ness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued an=
d tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the th=
oughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I retired to rest at n=
ight; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblan=
ce of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day. They congregate=
d round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the =
pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds=E2=
=80=94they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.</p>
<p>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of soul-inspiriti=
ng fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. The rain was=
 pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so =
that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetr=
ate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were rain=
 and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend=
 to the summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the =
tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first s=
aw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the =
soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The si=
ght of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of sol=
emnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I dete=
rmined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and =
the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.</=
p>
<p>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short =
windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain=
. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of th=
e winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on =
the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting =
rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you as=
cend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continual=
ly roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest=
 sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air=
 sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are=
 not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to t=
he scene. I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the r=
ivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite=
 mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured=
 from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from t=
he objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to=
 those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings. I=
f our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nea=
rly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word o=
r scene that that word may convey to us.</p>
<p class=3D"poem">We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We rise; one wand=E2=80=99ring thought pollutes th=
e day.<br>
We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;<br>

Man=E2=80=99s yesterday may ne=E2=80=99er be like his morrow;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nought may endure but mutability!<br></p>
<p>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some tim=
e I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both th=
at and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, =
and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like t=
he waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that =
sink deep. The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly=
 two hours in crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular ro=
ck. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the=
 distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I re=
mained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous sce=
ne. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mou=
ntains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glitteri=
ng peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was before =
sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, =E2=80=9CWande=
ring spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, all=
ow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the jo=
ys of life.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, =
advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in=
 the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he a=
pproached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled; a mist came over m=
y eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the =
cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tr=
emendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembl=
ed with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with=
 him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguis=
h, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness render=
ed it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rag=
e and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to=
 overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.</=
p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDevil,=E2=80=9D I exclaimed, =E2=80=9Cdo you dare approach me? =
And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserabl=
e head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dus=
t! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, =
restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI expected this reception,=E2=80=9D said the d=C3=A6mon. =E2=80=
=9CAll men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable =
beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy cre=
ature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation o=
f one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do =
your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankin=
d. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peac=
e; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated wi=
th the blood of your remaining friends.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAbhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are=
 too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with =
your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so ne=
gligently bestowed.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feeling=
s which can arm one being against the existence of another.</p>
<p>He easily eluded me and said,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBe calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your =
hatred on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to inc=
rease my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, =
is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more power=
ful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple. Bu=
t I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creat=
ure, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou=
 wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be =
not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice=
, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy =
creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom th=
ou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I al=
one am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fi=
end. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBegone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between =
you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, =
in which one must fall.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHow can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a fa=
vourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion? B=
elieve me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and hum=
anity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what=
 hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They spu=
rn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I h=
ave wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, ar=
e a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge. These bleak=
 skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the mu=
ltitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm t=
hemselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I wi=
ll keep no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my w=
retchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them fro=
m an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you=
 and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whi=
rlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. L=
isten to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as y=
ou shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by huma=
n laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are c=
ondemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you =
would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise t=
he eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and=
 then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhy do you call to my remembrance,=E2=80=9D I rejoined, =E2=80=
=9Ccircumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the misera=
ble origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you firs=
t saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!=
 You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power to =
consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from the sight=
 of your detested form.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThus I relieve thee, my creator,=E2=80=9D he said, and placed h=
is hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; =E2=80=
=9Cthus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen t=
o me and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I d=
emand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperat=
ure of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut u=
pon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to=
 hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world, you=
 will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit f=
or ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the sc=
ourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart was =
full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various a=
rguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale. I =
was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I ha=
d hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sou=
ght a confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I f=
elt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ough=
t to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives =
urged me to comply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and asce=
nded the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to desce=
nd; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy=
 heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating myself=
 by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.=

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap11"></a>Chapter 11</h2>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original=
 era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indisti=
nct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard=
, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I lear=
ned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees,=
 I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged=
 to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly ha=
d I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured =
in upon me again. I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found=
 a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had su=
rrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could =
wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount o=
r avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wear=
ying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was=
 the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting =
from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused m=
e from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hangin=
g on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook, and=
 then lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened=
, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitt=
ed your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some c=
lothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I =
was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, noth=
ing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSoon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensat=
ion of pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the=
 trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it e=
nlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries. I was still =
cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered=
 myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; =
all was confused. I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innum=
erable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; =
the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed m=
y eyes on that with pleasure.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSeveral changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night h=
ad greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each ot=
her. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink a=
nd the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I firs=
t discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded =
from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the=
 light from my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the fo=
rms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof o=
f light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs =
of the birds but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in=
 my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me f=
rightened me into silence again.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a less=
ened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensatio=
ns had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additio=
nal ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects i=
n their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degre=
es, one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh =
notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.</p=
>
<p>=E2=80=9COne day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had=
 been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the =
warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embe=
rs, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I though=
t, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the=
 materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I qu=
ickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was =
pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wo=
od which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. I ref=
lected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the caus=
e and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dr=
y it and have a plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sl=
eep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished=
. I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches u=
pon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sle=
ep.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the=
 fire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. =
I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embe=
rs when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I found, with =
pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery o=
f this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals =
that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury=
 than the berries I gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress m=
y food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I found that the =
berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improve=
d.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFood, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day s=
earching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I fo=
und this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to se=
ek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied=
. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I ha=
d obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave severa=
l hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged =
to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak,=
 I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days in t=
hese rambles and at length discovered the open country. A great fall of sno=
w had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform whit=
e; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold=
 damp substance that covered the ground.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food =
and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which h=
ad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a ne=
w sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding t=
he door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he w=
as preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me=
, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed=
 of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His appearance, dif=
ferent from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised m=
e. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain=
 could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as ex=
quisite and divine a retreat as Pand=C3=A6monium appeared to the d=C3=A6mon=
s of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured t=
he remnants of the shepherd=E2=80=99s breakfast, which consisted of bread, =
cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome=
 by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun,=
 which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my tr=
avels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant=E2=80=99s breakfast in a =
wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at s=
unset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The huts, the=
 neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns. The ve=
getables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windo=
ws of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I=
 entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the childr=
en shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The whole village was roused; so=
me fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many oth=
er kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully to=
ok refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance afte=
r the palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cot=
tage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought exp=
erience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, =
but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however=
, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and alth=
ough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asy=
lum from the snow and rain.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHere, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shel=
ter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more f=
rom the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel,=
 that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in t=
he habitation I had found. It was situated against the back of the cottage =
and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear poo=
l of water. One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covere=
d every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in =
such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light=
 I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHaving thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean str=
aw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembere=
d too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I ha=
d first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coar=
se bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conven=
iently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The =
floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vi=
cinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBeing thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until s=
omething should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a p=
aradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-droppin=
g branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about =
to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and=
 looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on h=
er head, passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanou=
r, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Y=
et she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being=
 her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patie=
nt yet sad. I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she retu=
rned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked=
 along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose coun=
tenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air o=
f melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage him=
self. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man aga=
in, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and th=
e girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.</=
p>
<p>=E2=80=9COn examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of th=
e cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled=
 up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink t=
hrough which the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice a small roo=
m was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture. In one cor=
ner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a =
disconsolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage=
; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hand=
s, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began=
 to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the =
nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never b=
eheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of=
 the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl e=
nticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears=
 from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notic=
e, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair =
creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her and smiled wit=
h such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and over=
powering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had ne=
ver before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I w=
ithdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSoon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulder=
s a load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of hi=
s burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fi=
re; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he sh=
owed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased and went in=
to the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and the=
n upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man we=
nt into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up r=
oots. After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined=
 him and they entered the cottage together.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appe=
arance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down =
to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again occupied=
 in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun=
 for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed i=
n beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. One was old, w=
ith silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the y=
ounger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded=
 with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost s=
adness and despondency. The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth,=
 with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his s=
teps across the fields.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CNight quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that t=
he cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was =
delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the ple=
asure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening the you=
ng girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did =
not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced=
 the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had =
finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monot=
onous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man=E2=80=99s instrume=
nt nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at tha=
t time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, e=
xtinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.=E2=80=9D</=

<p>=E2=80=9CI lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occu=
rrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these =
people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the=
 treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, an=
d resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to =
pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching a=
nd endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young =
woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed af=
ter the first meal.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded =
it. The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in var=
ious laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be=
 blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. N=
othing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibi=
ted towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him every lit=
tle office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by h=
is benevolent smiles.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThey were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion o=
ften went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,=
 but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, =
it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wret=
ched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful=
 house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to wa=
rm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in e=
xcellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another=E2=80=99s compa=
ny and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. What=
 did their tears imply? Did they really express pain? I was at first unable=
 to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me=
 many appearances which were at first enigmatic.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CA considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the ca=
uses of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suf=
fered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted e=
ntirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which ga=
ve very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure f=
ood to support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very=
 poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they p=
laced food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed=
, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, =
but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I ab=
stained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered=
 from a neighbouring wood.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI discovered also another means through which I was enabled to =
assist their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day=
 in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took =
his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing s=
ufficient for the consumption of several days.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, wh=
en she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seein=
g a great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voi=
ce, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with=
 pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repai=
ring the cottage and cultivating the garden.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBy degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found =
that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and =
feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words th=
ey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the min=
ds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and =
I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every=
 attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the wo=
rds they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, =
I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of t=
heir reference. By great application, however, and after having remained du=
ring the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered=
 the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discours=
e; I learned and applied the words, <i>fire, milk, bread,</i> and <i>wood.<=
/i> I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his=
 companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, wh=
ich was <i>father.</i> The girl was called <i>sister</i> or <i>Agatha,</i> =
and the youth <i>Felix, brother,</i> or <i>son</i>. I cannot describe the d=
elight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds=
 and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other words withou=
t being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as <i>good, dearest, =
unhappy.</i></p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beaut=
y of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I f=
elt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few h=
uman beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, t=
heir harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplis=
hments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to e=
ncourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast of=
f their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression =
of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respe=
ct, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe awa=
y unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were mor=
e cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was =
not thus with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my=
 unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his frie=
nds. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful=
 than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, m=
arked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty =
and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white =
flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning,=
 before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to=
 the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the ou=
thouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always rep=
lenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes f=
or a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return un=
til dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the g=
arden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the o=
ld man and Agatha.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees =
I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when h=
e talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for sp=
eech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; b=
ut how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for whic=
h they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but n=
ot sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied m=
y whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eage=
rly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the att=
empt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge mig=
ht enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with thi=
s also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted=
.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers=E2=80=94their g=
race, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I view=
ed myself in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe=
 that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fu=
lly convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled wit=
h the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did no=
t yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAs the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow =
vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time F=
elix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famin=
e disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wh=
olesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants=
 sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort in=
creased daily as the season advanced.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when =
it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its=
 waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the eart=
h, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I a=
ttended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in vario=
us occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my=
 friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night=
 was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel f=
or the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared th=
eir path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by =
Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible han=
d, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasi=
ons, utter the words <i>good spirit, wonderful</i>; but I did not then unde=
rstand the signification of these terms.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover th=
e motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know=
 why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wret=
ch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving p=
eople. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father,=
 the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upo=
n them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I=
 formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them,=
 and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until,=
 by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their fa=
vour and afterwards their love.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThese thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ar=
dour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but=
 supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tone=
s, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was =
as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were=
 affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment th=
an blows and execration.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altere=
d the aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been h=
id in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of culti=
vation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud =
forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation for gods, which, so =
short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elev=
ated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my m=
emory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of ho=
pe and anticipations of joy.=E2=80=9D</p>

<p>=E2=80=9CI now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relat=
e events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have =
made me what I am.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSpring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies =
cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should no=
w bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratifi=
ed and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of b=
eauty.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically res=
ted from labour=E2=80=94the old man played on his guitar, and the children =
listened to him=E2=80=94that I observed the countenance of Felix was melanc=
holy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in=
 his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of h=
is son=E2=80=99s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old ma=
n was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a g=
uide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black ve=
il. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronounc=
ing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical but unlike=
 that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily =
to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a count=
enance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black,=
 and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; =
her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, e=
ach cheek tinged with a lovely pink.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFelix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait=
 of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of e=
cstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes spa=
rkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him=
 as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings;=
 wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, w=
ho kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, hi=
s sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assis=
ted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cotta=
ge. Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young =
stranger knelt at the old man=E2=80=99s feet and would have kissed his hand=
, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate =
sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understo=
od by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I di=
d not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the=
 cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. =
Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabi=
an. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger=
, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that=
 he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, =
by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehe=
nd. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the s=
tranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their langu=
age; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the sa=
me instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at=
 the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before unde=
rstood, but I profited by the others.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAs night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When th=
ey separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, =E2=80=98Good =
night sweet Safie.=E2=80=99 He sat up much longer, conversing with his fath=
er, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lov=
ely guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to unde=
rstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utte=
rly impossible.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usua=
l occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the o=
ld man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful t=
hat they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, a=
nd her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nighti=
ngale of the woods.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at fi=
rst declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in s=
weet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man a=
ppeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain =
to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on =
him the greatest delight by her music.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alter=
ation that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends=
. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowled=
ge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the wor=
ds uttered by my protectors.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIn the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage=
, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the s=
cent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the su=
n became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were =
an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the=
 late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad duri=
ng daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endu=
red in the first village which I entered.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedi=
ly master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than t=
he Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whi=
lst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhile I improved in speech, I also learned the science of lette=
rs as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field=
 for wonder and delight.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney=E2=80=99s=
 <i>Ruins of Empires</i>. I should not have understood the purport of this =
book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had c=
hosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imita=
tion of the Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowled=
ge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the =
world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions o=
f the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of =
the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and =
wonderful virtue of the early Romans=E2=80=94of their subsequent degenerati=
ng=E2=80=94of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity,=
 and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept wi=
th Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThese wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. W=
as man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vi=
cious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle =
and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a g=
reat and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensiti=
ve being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the=
 lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or=
 harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go f=
orth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but=
 when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned =
away with disgust and loathing.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CEvery conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to m=
e. While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabi=
an, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the=
 division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, desc=
ent, and noble blood.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the=
 possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied=
 descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of thes=
e advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare ins=
tances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profi=
ts of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was abso=
lutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind =
of property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and lo=
athsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than th=
ey and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and col=
d with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I look=
ed around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot u=
pon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections infli=
cted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowle=
dge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt=
 beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COf what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind wh=
en it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes t=
o shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one m=
eans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death=E2=80=94a state =
which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings a=
nd loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I wa=
s shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtaine=
d by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased tha=
n satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle w=
ords of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for=
 me. The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of th=
e loved Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COther lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard =
of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the f=
ather doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the olde=
r child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the pr=
ecious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brot=
her, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being t=
o another in mutual bonds.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBut where were my friends and relations? No father had watched =
my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if th=
ey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I disting=
uished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in he=
ight and proportion. I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who clai=
med any intercourse with me. What was I? The question again recurred, to be=
 answered only with groans.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me=
 now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various fee=
lings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in addi=
tional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent=
, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).=E2=80=9D</p>

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap14"></a>Chapter 14</h2>
<p>=E2=80=9CSome time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. I=
t was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfoldi=
ng as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to o=
ne so utterly inexperienced as I was.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a g=
ood family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respe=
cted by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in the se=
rvice of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest dist=
inction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxur=
ious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoym=
ent which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moder=
ate fortune, could afford.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a =
Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some rea=
son which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was =
seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantin=
ople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The injustice of his=
 sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged tha=
t his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had bee=
n the cause of his condemnation.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFelix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror an=
d indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court. =
He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around=
 for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the pri=
son, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building=
, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with=
 chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix v=
isited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in =
his favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal =
of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offer=
s with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit=
 her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the you=
th could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treas=
ure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had=
 made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in =
his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should b=
e conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offe=
r, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consumma=
tion of his happiness.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDuring the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forw=
ard for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several=
 letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express=
 her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a serv=
ant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent=
 terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time s=
he gently deplored her own fate.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my re=
sidence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters=
 were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will give th=
em to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun=
 is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of=
 them to you.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSafie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and =
made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart=
 of the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and =
enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage=
 to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of=
 her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an=
 independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad. This=
 lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, =
who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured w=
ithin the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile a=
musements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand id=
eas and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian =
and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in socie=
ty was enchanting to her.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the nig=
ht previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many=
 leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father=
, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the forme=
r, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a jour=
ney and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.<=
/p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFelix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and acros=
s Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourabl=
e opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSafie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of hi=
s departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should=
 be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of=
 that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who=
 exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed=
 with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with t=
he interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her na=
tive country.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the=
 hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other p=
lans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian=
, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for h=
e knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose =
to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved a thou=
sand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it mig=
ht be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when =
he departed. His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Pari=
s.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of =
their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The pl=
ot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown int=
o prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure.=
 His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon w=
hile he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved. This ide=
a was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter =
should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return t=
o Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then=
, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself u=
p to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this p=
roceeding.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHe did not succeed. They remained confined for five months befo=
re the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune=
 and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThey found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where =
I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom h=
e and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that hi=
s deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good =
feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sen=
ding Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of futu=
re maintenance.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSuch were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rend=
ered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could =
have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virt=
ue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his b=
eloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The arrival of t=
he Arabian now infused new life into his soul.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his we=
alth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her =
lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous nature =
of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with he=
r father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CA few days after, the Turk entered his daughter=E2=80=99s apart=
ment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence =
at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to=
 the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to=
 Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He intended =
to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow a=
t her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arri=
ved at Leghorn.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct =
that it would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey=
 was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to i=
t. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the =
exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided. S=
he hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination. Taking =
with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted I=
taly with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common =
language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CShe arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the c=
ottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed h=
er with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian=
 was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly =
ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however, into good hands. T=
he Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, an=
d after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care =
that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.=E2=80=9D</p=

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap15"></a>Chapter 15</h2>
<p>=E2=80=9CSuch was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me d=
eeply. I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admi=
re their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAs yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and g=
enerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to becom=
e an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called =
forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the progress of my intelle=
ct, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the m=
onth of August of the same year.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COne night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood w=
here I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I f=
ound on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dr=
ess and some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my h=
ovel. Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of w=
hich I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of <i>Paradise Lost</i>,=
 a volume of <i>Plutarch=E2=80=99s Lives</i>, and the <i>Sorrows of Werter<=
/i>. The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now conti=
nually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friend=
s were employed in their ordinary occupations.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They pr=
oduced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised =
me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In th=
e <i>Sorrows of Werter</i>, besides the interest of its simple and affectin=
g story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what=
 had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending=
 source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it=
 described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for thei=
r object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my p=
rotectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom. But=
 I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or ima=
gined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquis=
itions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did=
 not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards t=
he opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely underst=
anding it.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAs I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feeling=
s and condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unli=
ke to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a l=
istener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I was unformed =
in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none. =E2=80=98The path of =
my departure was free,=E2=80=99 and there was none to lament my annihilatio=
n. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who w=
as I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questio=
ns continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe volume of <i>Plutarch=E2=80=99s Lives</i> which I possessed=
 contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. Th=
is book had a far different effect upon me from the <i>Sorrows of Werter</i=
>. I learned from Werter=E2=80=99s imaginations despondency and gloom, but =
Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere =
of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many thi=
ngs I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very confused=
 knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundle=
ss seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages =
of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I ha=
d studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of =
action. I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring =
their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and ab=
horrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms,=
 relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Indu=
ced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, N=
uma, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriar=
chal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on=
 my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a =
young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued w=
ith different sensations.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBut <i>Paradise Lost</i> excited different and far deeper emoti=
ons. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my ha=
nds, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the p=
icture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of excit=
ing. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me=
, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other bei=
ng in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other r=
espect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy a=
nd prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed =
to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, bu=
t I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered Satan as the=
 fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the blis=
s of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAnother circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.=
 Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket =
of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglect=
ed them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they w=
ere written, I began to study them with diligence. It was your journal of t=
he four months that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these p=
apers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mi=
ngled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You doubtless recollect these =
papers. Here they are. Everything is related in them which bears reference =
to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circum=
stances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my od=
ious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horr=
ors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. =E2=80=98Hateful day=
 when I received life!=E2=80=99 I exclaimed in agony. =E2=80=98Accursed cre=
ator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even <i>you</i> turned fro=
m me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his o=
wn image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the =
very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and en=
courage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThese were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solit=
ude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable an=
d benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become =
acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me =
and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn from their door one, ho=
wever monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved,=
 at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview =
with them which would decide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some mon=
ths longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a d=
read lest I should fail. Besides, I found that my understanding improved so=
 much with every day=E2=80=99s experience that I was unwilling to commence =
this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.<=
/p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSeveral changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. Th=
e presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also fo=
und that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent m=
ore time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours =
by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; t=
heir feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tu=
multuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a w=
retched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I=
 beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as=
 that frail image and that inconstant shade.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for th=
e trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowe=
d my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, an=
d dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings=
 and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of conso=
lation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my tho=
ughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam=E2=80=99s supplication to his Creator=
. But where was mine? He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my hear=
t I cursed him.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAutumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves =
decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it =
had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not h=
eed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation fo=
r the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief delights were the sight of =
the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deser=
ted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness=
 was not decreased by the absence of summer. They loved and sympathised wit=
h one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupte=
d by the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, th=
e greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart=
 yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their swe=
et looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambi=
tion. I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and =
horror. The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. I asked=
, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required =
kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.=
</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons ha=
d taken place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely=
 directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my prot=
ectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to =
enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity e=
nough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief=
 object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although=
 harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the ab=
sence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old D=
e Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COne day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the =
ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,=
 and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own des=
ire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took=
 up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and m=
ournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his countenance was=
 illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness=
 succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in refl=
ection.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, whi=
ch would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a n=
eighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excel=
lent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed=
 me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness o=
f which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel=
 to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determin=
ation I approached the door of their cottage.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI knocked. =E2=80=98Who is there?=E2=80=99 said the old man. =
=E2=80=98Come in.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI entered. =E2=80=98Pardon this intrusion,=E2=80=99 said I; =E2=
=80=98I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige m=
e if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.=E2=80=99</=
p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Enter,=E2=80=99 said De Lacey, =E2=80=98and I will try=
 in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my childre=
n are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult t=
o procure food for you.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it=
 is warmth and rest only that I need.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was =
precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the in=
terview, when the old man addressed me.</p>
<p>=E2=80=98By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; ar=
e you French?=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98No; but I was educated by a French family and understa=
nd that language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some frien=
ds, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.=E2=80=99<=
/p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Are they Germans?=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I =
am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relati=
on or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen =
me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an =
outcast in the world for ever.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfor=
tunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-intere=
st, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;=
 and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98They are kind=E2=80=94they are the most excellent crea=
tures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I h=
ave good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degre=
e beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought=
 to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.=
=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blam=
eless, cannot you undeceive them?=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that a=
ccount that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these frie=
nds; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily k=
indness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it i=
s that prejudice which I wish to overcome.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Where do these friends reside?=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Near this spot.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe old man paused and then continued, =E2=80=98If you will unr=
eservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of u=
se in undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, bu=
t there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere.=
 I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any w=
ay serviceable to a human creature.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous of=
fer. You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your=
 aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow cr=
eatures.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for t=
hat can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I a=
lso am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;=
 judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From=
 your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I =
shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success=
 with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98May I know the names and residence of those friends?=
=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which wa=
s to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for f=
irmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining=
 strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the=
 steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment to lose, but seizing th=
e hand of the old man, I cried, =E2=80=98Now is the time! Save and protect =
me! You and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me i=
n the hour of trial!=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Great God!=E2=80=99 exclaimed the old man. =E2=80=98Wh=
o are you?=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAt that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, =
and Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on beho=
lding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed=
 out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore=
 me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he das=
hed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have tor=
n him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my heart sank wit=
hin me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point of =
repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cotta=
ge, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.=E2=80=9D</p>

<p>=E2=80=9CCursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, d=
id I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestow=
ed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings wer=
e those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cotta=
ge and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and miser=
y.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; =
and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my a=
nguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the toi=
ls, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood =
with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable night I passed! The cold s=
tars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; no=
w and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal still=
ness. All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bo=
re a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear =
up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat =
down and enjoyed the ruin.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBut this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I bec=
ame fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in t=
he sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men that =
existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my =
enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the specie=
s, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to th=
is insupportable misery.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was im=
possible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid myself =
in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflect=
ion on my situation.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to so=
me degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cot=
tage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusion=
s. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation =
had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed =
my person to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarised the o=
ld De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of =
his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach. But I did =
not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I r=
esolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representatio=
ns win him to my party.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThese thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a pr=
ofound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by p=
eaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting=
 before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me f=
rom his father=E2=80=99s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was a=
lready night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of foo=
d.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the we=
ll-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crep=
t into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour w=
hen the family arose. That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens=
, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, apprehending some=
 dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no mo=
tion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CPresently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottag=
e, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did =
not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, w=
hich differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approa=
ched with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted t=
he cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discours=
e the meaning of these unusual appearances.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Do you consider,=E2=80=99 said his companion to him, =
=E2=80=98that you will be obliged to pay three months=E2=80=99 rent and to =
lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage=
, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your dete=
rmination.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98It is utterly useless,=E2=80=99 replied Felix; =E2=80=
=98we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the=
 greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. M=
y wife and my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you no=
t to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me f=
ly from this place.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFelix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion =
entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then dep=
arted. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state=
 of utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken the=
 only link that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of re=
venge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but=
 allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards inj=
ury and death. When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey,=
 the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these =
thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I=
 reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of=
 anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inani=
mate objects. As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around =
the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the=
 garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commenc=
e my operations.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAs the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and q=
uickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tor=
e along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spiri=
ts that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch=
 of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still f=
ixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A p=
art of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a=
 loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collecte=
d. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the f=
lames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying ton=
gues.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAs soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any pa=
rt of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the wood=
s.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAnd now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my ste=
ps? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hate=
d and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thoug=
ht of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my fath=
er, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who=
 had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, g=
eography had not been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situat=
ions of the different countries of the earth. You had mentioned Geneva as t=
he name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed.<=
/p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBut how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a =
southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only gu=
ide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor =
could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair. F=
rom you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no senti=
ment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You had endowed me w=
ith perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scor=
n and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for pity and redre=
ss, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted=
 to gain from any other being that wore the human form.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It w=
as late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. =
I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human be=
ing. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow p=
oured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was ha=
rd and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often did I =
imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fl=
ed, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer I appro=
ached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge =
enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I reste=
d not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of t=
he country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feeling=
s allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery=
 could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrive=
d on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and=
 the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the b=
itterness and horror of my feelings.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was=
 secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that =
my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after th=
e sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered eve=
n me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt=
 emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive w=
ithin me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myse=
lf to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dare=
d to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my hum=
id eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy =
upon me.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came t=
o its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which man=
y of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here=
 I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound =
of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. =
I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I =
was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport. She continued=
 her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foo=
t slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-plac=
e and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dra=
gged her to shore. She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in m=
y power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approa=
ch of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fle=
d. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, h=
astened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly=
 knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carr=
ied, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with incre=
ased swiftness, escaped into the wood.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human=
 being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the misera=
ble pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kin=
dness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave =
place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eter=
nal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame=
 me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFor some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavourin=
g to cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,=
 and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rat=
e I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the=
 oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My =
daily vows rose for revenge=E2=80=94a deep and deadly revenge, such as woul=
d alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAfter some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. T=
he labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or g=
entle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desola=
te state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoym=
ent of pleasure.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBut my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this=
 time I reached the environs of Geneva.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place =
among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply=
 to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy=
 the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind th=
e stupendous mountains of Jura.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAt this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflec=
tion, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came ru=
nning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. S=
uddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was=
 unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of de=
formity. If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion a=
nd friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CUrged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and dre=
w him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before =
his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his fac=
e and said, =E2=80=98Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to=
 hurt you; listen to me.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHe struggled violently. =E2=80=98Let me go,=E2=80=99 he cried; =
=E2=80=98monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. Yo=
u are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Boy, you will never see your father again; you must co=
me with me.=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic=E2=80=
=94he is M. Frankenstein=E2=80=94he will punish you. You dare not keep me.=
=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy=E2=80=94to h=
im towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.=
=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which car=
ried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a mom=
ent he lay dead at my feet.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and =
hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, =E2=80=98I too can create =
desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to =
him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.=E2=80=99<=
/p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAs I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on =
his breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite o=
f my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed wit=
h delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; bu=
t presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was for ever deprived of =
the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose =
resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of=
 divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CCan you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I o=
nly wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclama=
tions and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to =
destroy them.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhile I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I=
 had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I ente=
red a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on so=
me straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I he=
ld, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and =
health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bes=
towed on all but me. And then I bent over her and whispered, =E2=80=98Awake=
, fairest, thy lover is near=E2=80=94he who would give his life but to obta=
in one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!=E2=80=99</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should =
she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus=
 would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. The=
 thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me=E2=80=94not I, but she=
, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of=
 all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in h=
er; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguina=
ry laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her and pla=
ced the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again=
, and I fled.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFor some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken p=
lace, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world an=
d its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and =
have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion w=
hich you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have promised to comp=
ly with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man will not associate wi=
th me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to=
 me. My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects. Th=
is being you must create.=E2=80=9D</p>

<p>The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectati=

 you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred.=
 Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate =
your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into=
 contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed=
 himself and proceeded=E2=80=94</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for yo=
u do not reflect that <i>you</i> are the cause of its excess. If any being =
felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and=
 a hundredfold; for that one creature=E2=80=99s sake I would make peace wit=
h the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be reali=
sed. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of a=
nother sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is=
 all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be m=
onsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more a=
ttached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harml=
ess and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let=
 me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite th=
e sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of =
my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tal=
e and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sen=
sations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness th=
at it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling and continued,=
</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIf you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall eve=
r see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is no=
t that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; a=
corns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of=
 the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare. We shall=
 make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will =
ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you=
 must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruel=
ty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes=
; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so =
ardently desire.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou propose,=E2=80=9D replied I, =E2=80=9Cto fly from the habit=
ations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will b=
e your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of =
man, persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness=
, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be rene=
wed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destructi=
on. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHow inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were mov=
ed by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my compla=
ints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me=
, that with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man =
and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions=
 will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly =
away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and sometim=
es felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the f=
ilthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were al=
tered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I =
thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold=
 from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to besto=
w.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou swear,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cto be harmless; but have y=
ou not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me dist=
rust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by a=
ffording a wider scope for your revenge?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHow is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer=
. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; =
the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become=
 a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices are the chi=
ldren of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily ar=
ise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of =
a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events fr=
om which I am now excluded.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various argu=
ments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he h=
ad displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of a=
ll kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manife=
sted towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations=
; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers and hide hims=
elf from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being po=
ssessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of ref=
lection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creature=
s demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, the=
refore, I said,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe fo=
r ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I sha=
ll deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI swear,=E2=80=9D he cried, =E2=80=9Cby the sun, and by the blu=
e sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you g=
rant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to=
 your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unu=
tterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in =
my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the f=
light of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice=
.</p>
<p>His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of t=
he horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towar=
ds the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart wa=
s heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of=
 the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupie=
d as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. N=
ight was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated m=
yself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passe=
d from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a=
 broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and s=
tirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands i=
n agony, I exclaimed, =E2=80=9COh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all a=
bout to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me b=
ecome as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how=
 the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to e=
very blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me=
.</p>
<p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no r=
est, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give =
no expression to my sensations=E2=80=94they weighed on me with a mountain=
=E2=80=99s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I =
returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family. My h=
aggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question,=
 scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed under a ban=E2=80=94as if=
 I had no right to claim their sympathies=E2=80=94as if never more might I =
enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and=
 to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The =
prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence p=
ass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of =
life.</p>

<a id=3D"chap18"></a>Chapter 18</h2>
<p>Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and =
I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the vengean=
ce of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to=
 the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female =
without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disqu=
isition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English phi=
losopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometime=
s thought of obtaining my father=E2=80=99s consent to visit England for thi=
s purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking th=
e first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear le=
ss absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which =
had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecke=
d by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw t=
his change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best metho=
d of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then wou=
ld return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching =
sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I pa=
ssed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and=
 listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh=
 air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure=
, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile=
 and a more cheerful heart.</p>
<p>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling=
 me aside, thus addressed me,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your f=
ormer pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still=
 unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjectur=
e as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is we=
ll founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not =
only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued=E2=80=94</=
p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your ma=
rriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the s=
tay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your earlie=
st infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes,=
 entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man that=
 what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely de=
stroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that =
she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may=
 love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this strug=
gle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly an=
d sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warme=
st admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bou=
nd up in the expectation of our union.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Vict=
or, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you fe=
el thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a glo=
om over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a ho=
ld of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you o=
bject to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage. We have been unfortuna=
te, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitti=
ng my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possess=
ed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all i=
nterfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have form=
ed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or tha=
t a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my =
words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincer=
ity.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable =
of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thought=
s and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me the idea of an =
immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay. I was bound=
 by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or =
if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted fa=
mily! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging rou=
nd my neck and bowing me to the ground? I must perform my engagement and le=
t the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the del=
ight of a union from which I expected peace.</p>
<p>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to =
England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of t=
hat country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me=
 in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired inte=
lligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable =
aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father=
=E2=80=99s house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved=
. I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of wh=
ich would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I wa=
s aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hid=
ing the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of m=
y unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus em=
ployed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restor=
ed to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled, the monster w=
ould depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might mean=
while occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever.</p>
<p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to vi=
sit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my =
desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire w=
ith an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply. After so long a=
 period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity =
and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in t=
he idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amu=
sement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself.</p>
<p>The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or a=
t most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind precaution he=
 had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without previously communicatin=
g with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should =
join me at Strasburgh. This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the =
prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence =
of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that th=
us I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry=
 might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would=
 he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task =
or to contemplate its progress?</p>
<p>To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union =
with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father=E2=80=
=99s age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one =
reward I promised myself from my detested toils=E2=80=94one consolation for=
 my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranch=
ised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past=
 in my union with her.</p>
<p>I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which=
 filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my fri=
ends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his a=
ttacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to =
follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England? Th=
is imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed=
 the safety of my friends. I was agonised with the idea of the possibility =
that the reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period during =
which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the=
 impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that =
the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machi=
nations.</p>
<p>It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native cou=
ntry. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquie=
sced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away fr=
om her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had been her care which provide=
d me a companion in Clerval=E2=80=94and yet a man is blind to a thousand mi=
nute circumstances which call forth a woman=E2=80=99s sedulous attention. S=
he longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rende=
red her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell.</p>
<p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly know=
ing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembe=
red only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order=
 that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me. Filled with d=
reary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, bu=
t my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of m=
y travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.</p>
<p>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed ma=
ny leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. H=
e came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He was alive to every =
new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more hap=
py when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me th=
e shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky. =E2=80=
=9CThis is what it is to live,=E2=80=9D he cried; =E2=80=9Cnow I enjoy exis=
tence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorr=
owful!=E2=80=9D In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw=
 the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rh=
ine. And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerv=
al, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in li=
stening to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that s=
hut up every avenue to enjoyment.</p>
<p>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterda=
m, whence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage we passed m=
any willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at Man=
nheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Main=
z. The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque. The r=
iver descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of =
beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precip=
ices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rh=
ine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you vi=
ew rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the=
 dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flouri=
shing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populou=
s towns occupy the scene.</p>
<p>We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labour=
ers as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits=
 continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the =
bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to d=
rink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these we=
re my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had bee=
n transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. =
=E2=80=9CI have seen,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cthe most beautiful scenes =
of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the s=
nowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black a=
nd impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance =
were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay =
appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore=
 up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must b=
e on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain=
, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and wh=
ere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the ni=
ghtly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; b=
ut this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mounta=
ins of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in t=
he banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled. Look at tha=
t castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost=
 concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of=
 labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the =
recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this=
 place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier =
or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words an=
d to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a =
being formed in the =E2=80=9Cvery poetry of nature.=E2=80=9D His wild and e=
nthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His =
soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devo=
ted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only i=
n the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy=
 his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only w=
ith admiration, he loved with ardour:=E2=80=94</p>
<p class=3D"poem">=E2=80=94=E2=80=94The sounding cataract<br>
Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,<br>
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,<br>
Their colours and their forms, were then to him<br>
An appetite; a feeling, and a love,<br>

<p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ev=

No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty,=

<p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tri=

le.</p>
<p>Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to=
 post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of=
 the river was too gentle to aid us.</p>
<p>Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but w=
e arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England=
. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first s=
aw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new sce=
ne; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the rem=
embrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Arma=
da, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich=E2=80=94places which I had heard of =
even in my country.</p>
<p>At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul=E2=80=99s tow=
ering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.</p>

<a id=3D"chap19"></a>Chapter 19</h2>
<p>London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several mo=
nths in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse=
 of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was =
with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of ob=
taining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quic=
kly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with m=
e, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.</p>
<p>If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, i=
t would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over=
 my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the informat=
ion they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly =
profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with =
the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could =
thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous =
faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier pla=
ced between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of=
 William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those nam=
es filled my soul with anguish.</p>
<p>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and=
 anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners whic=
h he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amuseme=
nt. He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was =
to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various l=
anguages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materi=
ally assisting the progress of European colonization and trade. In Britain =
only could he further the execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and =
the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I trie=
d to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the =
pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturb=
ed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, al=
leging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to c=
ollect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like=
 the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Ever=
y thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word tha=
t I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpi=
tate.</p>
<p>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person =
in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the b=
eauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient all=
urements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where h=
e resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, althou=
gh I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all t=
he wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.</p>
<p>We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now Fe=
bruary. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north=
 at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend t=
o follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock=
, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this t=
our about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and the mate=
rials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook =
in the northern highlands of Scotland.</p>
<p>We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windso=
r, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineer=
s; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer w=
ere all novelties to us.</p>
<p>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds w=
ere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted ther=
e more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had co=
llected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole=
 nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liber=
ty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Fal=
kland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to=
 every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited. The=
 spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its =
footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the =
appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our ad=
miration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost =
magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of =
exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which r=
eflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed=
 among aged trees.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the me=
mory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peace=
ful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, an=
d if I was ever overcome by <i>ennui</i>, the sight of what is beautiful in=
 nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of=
 man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirit=
s. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then t=
hat I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be=E2=80=94a mis=
erable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to=
 myself.</p>
<p>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs a=
nd endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most anima=
ting epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often p=
rolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited th=
e tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell.=
 For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to=
 contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these =
sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to =
shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but th=
e iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, i=
nto my miserable self.</p>
<p>We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next =
place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, =
to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a low=
er scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which al=
ways attend on the piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wond=
rous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities=
 are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamou=
nix. The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hasten=
ed to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.</p>
<p>From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberl=
and and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mounta=
ins. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of=
 the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all fa=
miliar and dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who alm=
ost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was propor=
tionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of tale=
nt, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he=
 could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his=
 inferiors. =E2=80=9CI could pass my life here,=E2=80=9D said he to me; =E2=
=80=9Cand among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and th=
e Rhine.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>But he found that a traveller=E2=80=99s life is one that includes much p=
ain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and wh=
en he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on =
which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his atten=
tion, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.</p>
<p>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland =
and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of o=
ur appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to trave=
l on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for s=
ome time, and I feared the effects of the d=C3=A6mon=E2=80=99s disappointme=
nt. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.=
 This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might o=
therwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with fever=
ish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thou=
sand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth=
 or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I th=
ought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murder=
ing my companion. When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry =
for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fanci=
ed rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, th=
e consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed draw=
n down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.</p>
<p>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might =
have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well=
 as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. =
But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic ca=
stle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur=E2=80=99s S=
eat, St. Bernard=E2=80=99s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him fo=
r the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was imp=
atient to arrive at the termination of my journey.</p>
<p>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew=E2=80=99=
s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. =
But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their f=
eelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingl=
y I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone. =E2=80=
=9CDo you,=E2=80=9D said I, =E2=80=9Cenjoy yourself, and let this be our re=
ndezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my moti=
ons, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and wh=
en I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your=
 own temper.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to =
remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. =E2=80=9CI had rather be with =
you,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cin your solitary rambles, than with these S=
cotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, =
that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your ab=
sence.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of =
Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the monst=
er followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished=
, that he might receive his companion.</p>
<p>With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one=
 of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place =
fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were=
 continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely afford=
ing pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, whic=
h consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of t=
heir miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxur=
ies, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was =
about five miles distant.</p>
<p>On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of thes=
e was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two rooms, and =
these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatc=
h had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinge=
s. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession,=
 an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not al=
l the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As=
 it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance=
 of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the co=
arsest sensations of men.</p>
<p>In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, whe=
n the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen t=
o the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous yet e=
ver-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from thi=
s desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and i=
ts cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a b=
lue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as =
the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocea=
n.</p>
<p>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as=
 I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to=
 me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for sev=
eral days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete m=
y work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged. During my =
first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horro=
r of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my la=
bour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went=
 to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.<=
/p>
<p>Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a=
 solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the act=
ual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restles=
s and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat=
 with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should e=
ncounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander f=
rom the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to clai=
m his companion.</p>
<p>In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably adv=
anced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, whi=
ch I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscu=
re forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.</p>

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap20"></a>Chapter 20</h2>
<p>I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was ju=
st rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I=
 remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my la=
bour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to =
it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider=
 the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was engaged in =
the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had de=
solated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse. I was n=
ow about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; =
she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and deligh=
t, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the n=
eighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, =
who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might=
 refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might even =
hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, =
and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before h=
is eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to th=
e superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exaspe=
rated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.=
</p>
<p>Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new wor=
ld, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the d=C3=A6m=
on thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upo=
n the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condi=
tion precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit, to inf=
lict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved by th=
e sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his f=
iendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise =
burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as thei=
r pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the pri=
ce, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.</p>
<p>I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by =
the light of the moon the d=C3=A6mon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkl=
ed his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had=
 allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in =
forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; a=
nd he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.<=
/p>
<p>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malic=
e and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of cre=
ating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the t=
hing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whos=
e future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish d=
espair and revenge, withdrew.</p>
<p>I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart=
 never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my ow=
n apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and reli=
eve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p>
<p>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; i=
t was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed =
under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the wa=
ter, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the f=
ishermen called to one another. I felt the silence, although I was hardly c=
onscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by t=
he paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.<=
/p>
<p>In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one =
endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a prese=
ntiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in =
a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helples=
sness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly=
 from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.</p>
<p>Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door ope=
ned, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approach=
ed me and said in a smothered voice,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that yo=
u intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery=
; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among=
 its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many mo=
nths in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have end=
ured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hop=
es?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBegone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like=
 yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSlave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself=
 unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe your=
self miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will b=
e hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!=E2=80=9D<=
/p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your pow=
er is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but =
they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice.=
 Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a d=C3=A6mon whose deligh=
t is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your words will only=
 exasperate my rage.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the=
 impotence of anger. =E2=80=9CShall each man,=E2=80=9D cried he, =E2=80=9Cf=
ind a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I h=
ad feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn. =
Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery, an=
d soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for eve=
r. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? =
You can blast my other passions, but revenge remains=E2=80=94revenge, hence=
forth dearer than light or food! I may die, but first you, my tyrant and to=
rmentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware, for I am fe=
arless and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, t=
hat I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you i=
nflict.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDevil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of ma=
lice. I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend bene=
ath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wed=
ding-night.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I started forward and exclaimed, =E2=80=9CVillain! Before you sign my de=
ath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with pre=
cipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the w=
aters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.</p>
<p>All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage =
to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I wa=
lked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjur=
ed up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not followed him=
 and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him to depart, an=
d he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered to think who=
 might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I t=
hought again of his words=E2=80=94=E2=80=9C<i>I will be with you on your we=
dding-night.</i>=E2=80=9D That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilme=
nt of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extingu=
ish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of=
 my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should fin=
d her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed f=
or many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my=
 enemy without a bitter struggle.</p>
<p>The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings beca=
me calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks int=
o the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last nig=
ht=E2=80=99s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost=
 regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay=
, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I =
might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrup=
ted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed o=
r to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a d=C3=A6mon whom I=
 had myself created.</p>
<p>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it l=
oved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose=
 higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had=
 been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and =
my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep into which I now sank re=
freshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of hu=
man beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with gr=
eater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a de=
ath-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a rea=
lity.</p>
<p>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my a=
ppetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishin=
g-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contain=
ed letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him. He =
said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that lette=
rs from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete =
the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He could n=
ot any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be fo=
llowed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entre=
ated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besough=
t me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that w=
e might proceed southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to=
 life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.</p=
>
<p>Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddere=
d to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose =
I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I mus=
t handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next mo=
rning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of =
my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destro=
yed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the =
living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and then entered =
the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room=
, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite=
 the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into =
a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined t=
o throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon t=
he beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place =
in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d=C3=A6mon. I had b=
efore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whate=
ver consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been t=
aken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly. The ide=
a of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I =
had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary ac=
t of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own mind that to create anot=
her like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most =
atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could=
 lead to a different conclusion.</p>
<p>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting =
my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore=
. The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land=
, but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a=
 dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my f=
ellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was sud=
denly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of da=
rkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as=
 it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but th=
e air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then risi=
ng. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I=
 resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direc=
t position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon=
, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its kee=
l cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept =
soundly.</p>
<p>I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I =
found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and=
 the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found th=
at the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from w=
hich I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found th=
at if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with wate=
r. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess =
that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me and was so=
 slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the=
 sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic =
and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasura=
ble waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many =
hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other suffe=
rings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew befo=
re the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was t=
o be my grave. =E2=80=9CFiend,=E2=80=9D I exclaimed, =E2=80=9Cyour task is =
already fulfilled!=E2=80=9D I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Cl=
erval=E2=80=94all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sangui=
nary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so despair=
ing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing =
before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.</p>
<p>Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the =
horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free fr=
om breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly =
able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards th=
e south.</p>
<p>Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured f=
or several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm=
 joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.</p>
<p>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we h=
ave of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a=
 part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a =
wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived th=
e traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself sudd=
enly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I carefully tr=
aced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw is=
suing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of extreme debili=
ty, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could =
most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I turn=
ed the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I=
 entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.</p>
<p>As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several pe=
ople crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my appearance,=
 but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gesture=
s that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of al=
arm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore =
addressed them in that language. =E2=80=9CMy good friends,=E2=80=9D said I,=
 =E2=80=9Cwill you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and infor=
m me where I am?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou will know that soon enough,=E2=80=9D replied a man with a h=
oarse voice. =E2=80=9CMaybe you are come to a place that will not prove muc=
h to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promi=
se you.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a strang=
er, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry counte=
nances of his companions. =E2=80=9CWhy do you answer me so roughly?=E2=80=
=9D I replied. =E2=80=9CSurely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receiv=
e strangers so inhospitably.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI do not know,=E2=80=9D said the man, =E2=80=9Cwhat the custom =
of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly inc=
rease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoye=
d and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but no one =
replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd a=
s they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapp=
ed me on the shoulder and said, =E2=80=9CCome, sir, you must follow me to M=
r. Kirwin=E2=80=99s to give an account of yourself.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWho is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is no=
t this a free country?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAy, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistra=
te, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was foun=
d murdered here last night.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocen=
t; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in sile=
nce and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink =
from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it poli=
tic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed =
into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity=
 that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and des=
pair all fear of ignominy or death.</p>
<p>I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory=
 of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to m=
y recollection.</p>

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap21"></a>Chapter 21</h2>
<p>I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevo=
lent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some =
degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who a=
ppeared as witnesses on this occasion.</p>
<p>About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magi=
strate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his s=
on and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o=E2=80=99clock, they=
 observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for =
port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not=
 land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about tw=
o miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, a=
nd his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding along=
 the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on =
the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their=
 lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all=
 appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of som=
e person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on =
examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body=
 was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woma=
n near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. It app=
eared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. He ha=
d apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except t=
he black mark of fingers on his neck.</p>
<p>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but =
when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my br=
other and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist cam=
e over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magist=
rate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury =
from my manner.</p>
<p>The son confirmed his father=E2=80=99s account, but when Daniel Nugent w=
as called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, h=
e saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; =
and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same b=
oat in which I had just landed.</p>
<p>A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the do=
or of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour b=
efore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only=
 one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was af=
terwards found.</p>
<p>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the =
body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and rubbed it,=
 and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.</p=
>
<p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed t=
hat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was ve=
ry probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to =
return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they obs=
erved that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and =
it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put =
into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of =E2=80=94=E2=80=94=
 from the place where I had deposited the corpse.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken int=
o the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what=
 effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably sugge=
sted by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder h=
ad been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and sever=
al other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange =
coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing =
that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabit=
ed about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as=
 to the consequences of the affair.</p>
<p>I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. Ho=
w can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with hor=
ror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony=
. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed lik=
e a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stre=
tched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I ex=
claimed, =E2=80=9CHave my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dear=
est Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their=
 destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and =
I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.</p>
<p>A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; m=
y ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murde=
rer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attend=
ants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; =
and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, a=
nd screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native =
language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries =
were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.</p>
<p>Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I no=
t sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming child=
ren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful l=
overs have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a pre=
y for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I made that I =
could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, con=
tinually renewed the torture?</p>
<p>But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from =
a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, t=
urnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was mornin=
g, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the part=
iculars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had =
suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred window=
s and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my mem=
ory and I groaned bitterly.</p>
<p>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me.=
 She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenanc=
e expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class. Th=
e lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to =
see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire=
 indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one =
that I had heard during my sufferings.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAre you better now, sir?=E2=80=9D said she.</p>
<p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, =E2=80=9CI believe =
I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I a=
m still alive to feel this misery and horror.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFor that matter,=E2=80=9D replied the old woman, =E2=80=9Cif yo=
u mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for =
you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that=
=E2=80=99s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I =
do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a spe=
ech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid a=
nd unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life ap=
peared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, fo=
r it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.</p>
<p>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feveri=
sh; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with th=
e gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The physician came and p=
rescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter care=
lessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was stro=
ngly marked in the visage of the second. Who could be interested in the fat=
e of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?</p>
<p>These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had =
shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to be =
prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provi=
ded a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me, for alth=
ough he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature,=
 he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a mu=
rderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but =
his visits were short and with long intervals.</p>
<p>One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my e=
yes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gl=
oom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to r=
emain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I c=
onsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty=
 of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thought=
s when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His coun=
tenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine an=
d addressed me in French,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anythi=
ng to make you more comfortable?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the =
whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.=E2=80=9D</=
p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little rel=
ief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, =
I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily =
be brought to free you from the criminal charge.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThat is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, =
become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and h=
ave been, can death be any evil to me?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CNothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the=
 strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surpri=
sing accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediat=
ely, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your ey=
es was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and p=
laced, as it were, by some fiend across your path.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this=
 retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the know=
ledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was e=
xhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CImmediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were=
 on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover =
some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfo=
rtune and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I =
discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote =
to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.=
 But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any =
kind.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible =
event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I a=
m now to lament?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYour family is perfectly well,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Kirwin with ge=
ntleness; =E2=80=9Cand someone, a friend, is come to visit you.=E2=80=9D</p=
>
<p>I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it in=
stantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery=
 and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comp=
ly with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in=
 agony,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God=E2=80=99s sake, do=
 not let him enter!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help re=
garding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a se=
vere tone,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI should have thought, young man, that the presence of your fat=
her would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy father!=E2=80=9D cried I, while every feature and every musc=
le was relaxed from anguish to pleasure. =E2=80=9CIs my father indeed come?=
 How kind, how very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he tho=
ught that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now=
 he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and quitted the room =
with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.</p>
<p>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the a=
rrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAre you then safe=E2=80=94and Elizabeth=E2=80=94and Ernest?=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by=
 dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my despond=
ing spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerful=
ness. =E2=80=9CWhat a place is this that you inhabit, my son!=E2=80=9D said=
 he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of th=
e room. =E2=80=9CYou travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to p=
ursue you. And poor Clerval=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too grea=
t to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAlas! Yes, my father,=E2=80=9D replied I; =E2=80=9Csome destiny=
 of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or =
surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precario=
us state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure=
 tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not =
be exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to m=
e like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.</p>
<p>As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancho=
ly that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was for ever before m=
e, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which these refl=
ections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! Why did t=
hey preserve so miserable and detested a life? It was surely that I might f=
ulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, wil=
l death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight o=
f anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice=
, I shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, alth=
ough the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours mo=
tionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury=
 me and my destroyer in its ruins.</p>
<p>The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in=
 prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse=
, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where =
the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collectin=
g witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared the disgrace of appearin=
g publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that=
 decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being =
proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend w=
as found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.</p>
<p>My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a cri=
minal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and =
permitted to return to my native country. I did not participate in these fe=
elings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. Th=
e cup of life was poisoned for ever, and although the sun shone upon me, as=
 upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and f=
rightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that =
glared upon me. Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishi=
ng in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black la=
shes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the mo=
nster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.</p>
<p>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of =
Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words=
 only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happin=
ess and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, wit=
h a devouring <i>maladie du pays</i>, to see once more the blue lake and ra=
pid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general s=
tate of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence a=
s the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but =
by paroxysms of anguish and despair. At these moments I often endeavoured t=
o put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendan=
ce and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violen=
ce.</p>
<p>Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed=
 over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should return without del=
ay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and =
to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of =
his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might,=
 with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image whi=
ch I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father =
still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the =
fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck=E2=80=94the shadow of a =
human being. My strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night a=
nd day preyed upon my wasted frame.</p>
<p>Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatienc=
e, my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vesse=
l bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shore=
s. It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to=
 the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my =
sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should=
 soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream=
; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested sh=
ore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that =
I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest compani=
on, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, i=
n my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with my famil=
y in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I rem=
embered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation =
of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived=
. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed =
upon me, and I wept bitterly.</p>
<p>Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of takin=
g every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this dru=
g only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation o=
f life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swal=
lowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not=
 afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand =
objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightm=
are; I felt the fiend=E2=80=99s grasp in my neck and could not free myself =
from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was watching over=
 me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, t=
he cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling=
 that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible=
, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which t=
he human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.</p>

<a id=3D"chap22"></a>Chapter 22</h2>
<p>The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon fou=
nd that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could c=
ontinue my journey. My father=E2=80=99s care and attentions were indefatiga=
ble, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous m=
ethods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in socie=
ty. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my=
 fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them,=
 as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt t=
hat I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy amo=
ng them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. =
How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they=
 know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!</p>
<p>My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by =
various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt de=
eply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he =
endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAlas! My father,=E2=80=9D said I, =E2=80=9Chow little do you kn=
ow me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded =
if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as inn=
ocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the=
 cause of this=E2=80=94I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry=E2=80=94=
they all died by my hands.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same asse=
rtion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explana=
tion, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium=
, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself =
to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence=
. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the w=
retch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and =
this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But, besides, I could=
 not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with cons=
ternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I c=
hecked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I w=
ould have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet, still, wo=
rds like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I could =
offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden o=
f my mysterious woe.</p>
<p>Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonde=
r, =E2=80=9CMy dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I ent=
reat you never to make such an assertion again.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI am not mad,=E2=80=9D I cried energetically; =E2=80=9Cthe sun =
and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my trut=
h. I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machin=
ations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to h=
ave saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacri=
fice the whole human race.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were der=
anged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavo=
ured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to o=
bliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and neve=
r alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.</p>
<p>As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my he=
art, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes;=
 sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violen=
ce I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to=
 declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more com=
posed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice.</p>
<p>A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received th=
e following letter from Elizabeth:</p>
<p class=3D"letter">=E2=80=9CMy dear Friend,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my un=
cle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may h=
ope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must =
have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quit=
ted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have =
been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and t=
o find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so mi=
serable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you=
 at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversatio=
n that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanati=
on necessary before we meet.</p>
<p>Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? I=
f you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfie=
d. But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and y=
et be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the=
 case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I =
have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin=
.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite pl=
an of your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, an=
d taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place.=
 We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear an=
d valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister=
 often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a m=
ore intimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor.=
 Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth=E2=80=
=94Do you not love another?</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou have travelled; you have spent several years of your life a=
t Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last aut=
umn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I co=
uld not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe you=
rself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they o=
pposed themselves to your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I conf=
ess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futuri=
ty you have been my constant friend and companion. But it is your happiness=
 I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would r=
ender me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free ch=
oice. Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest=
 misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word <i>honour</i>, all hope of that l=
ove and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who have so=
 disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by =
being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured that your cousin a=
nd playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this=
 supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, =
remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my =
tranquillity.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDo not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or =
the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle wi=
ll send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips whe=
n we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need n=
o other happiness.</p>

<p>This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat=
 of the fiend=E2=80=94=E2=80=9C<i>I will be with you on your wedding-night!=
</i>=E2=80=9D Such was my sentence, and on that night would the d=C3=A6mon =
employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness wh=
ich promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he had determin=
ed to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle =
would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be=
 at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I shou=
ld be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the peasant enjoys when his f=
amily have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands lai=
d waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free.=
 Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasur=
e, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue =
me until death.</p>
<p>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some soft=
ened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams =
of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel=E2=80=99s a=
rm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If t=
he monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I conside=
red whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed a=
rrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postpon=
ed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps mo=
re dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed <i>to be with me on my wedding-n=
ight</i>, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in th=
e meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, h=
e had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats. I =
resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduc=
e either to hers or my father=E2=80=99s happiness, my adversary=E2=80=99s d=
esigns against my life should not retard it a single hour.</p>
<p>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affec=
tionate. =E2=80=9CI fear, my beloved girl,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Clittle=
 happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is cen=
tred in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my li=
fe and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dread=
ful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and th=
en, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I surv=
ive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror to y=
ou the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there=
 must be perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do n=
ot mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you w=
ill comply.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth=E2=80=99s letter we retur=
ned to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears we=
re in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw =
a change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vi=
vacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of com=
passion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I wa=
s.</p>
<p>The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madn=
ess with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possess=
ed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despo=
ndent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered=
 by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.</p>
<p>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voi=
ce would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human fe=
elings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason return=
ed, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah!=
 It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is=
 no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise some=
times found in indulging the excess of grief.</p>
<p>Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Eliz=
abeth. I remained silent.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHave you, then, some other attachment?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CNone on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union w=
ith delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate my=
self, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befal=
len us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love =
for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be small=
 but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when t=
ime shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be =
born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.=E2=80=9D</p=
>
<p>Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the thr=
eat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been=
 in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that =
when he had pronounced the words =E2=80=9C<i>I shall be with you on your we=
dding-night</i>,=E2=80=9D I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidabl=
e. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with =
it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed=
 with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take p=
lace in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.</p>
<p>Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish in=
tention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for e=
ver from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth=
 than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of ma=
gic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I t=
hought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dear=
er victim.</p>
<p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice=
 or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my=
 feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the c=
ountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer ey=
e of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, no=
t unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that =
what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into =
an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.</p>
<p>Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were receive=
d, and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my =
own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestnes=
s into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decora=
tions of my tragedy. Through my father=E2=80=99s exertions a part of the in=
heritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.=
 A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It was agreed th=
at, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spe=
nd our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stoo=
d.</p>
<p>In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the =
fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger constantly ab=
out me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means ga=
ined a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, th=
e threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to distu=
rb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater =
appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer =
and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident cou=
ld possibly prevent.</p>
<p>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to cal=
m her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she=
 was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also =
she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on=
 the following day. My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bu=
stle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the dif=
fidence of a bride.</p>
<p>After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father=E2=
=80=99s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey=
 by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the fo=
llowing day. The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nupti=
al embarkation.</p>
<p>Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feelin=
g of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were shelt=
ered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the s=
cene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Sal=C3=AAve, the=
 pleasant banks of Montal=C3=A8gre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the=
 beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain e=
ndeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the =
mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its nati=
ve country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should =
wish to enslave it.</p>
<p>I took the hand of Elizabeth. =E2=80=9CYou are sorrowful, my love. Ah! I=
f you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeav=
our to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at=
 least permits me to enjoy.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBe happy, my dear Victor,=E2=80=9D replied Elizabeth; =E2=80=9C=
there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively =
joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to=
 me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I =
will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along an=
d how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome=
 of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting. Look al=
so at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we =
can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day! Ho=
w happy and serene all nature appears!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all refl=
ection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a =
few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distractio=
n and reverie.</p>
<p>The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observ=
ed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hil=
ls. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheat=
re of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone =
under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain=
 by which it was overhung.</p>
<p>The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, san=
k at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caus=
ed a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which=
 it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank benea=
th the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares =
and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever.</p>

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap23"></a>Chapter 23</h2>
<p>It was eight o=E2=80=99clock when we landed; we walked for a short time =
on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn an=
d contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured i=
n darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.</p>
<p>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in=
 the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning=
 to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vult=
ure and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy hea=
vens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to ri=
se. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.</p>
<p>I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes=
 of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful,=
 while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every s=
ound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not =
shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was exti=
nguished.</p>
<p>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silen=
ce, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, =
and trembling, she asked, =E2=80=9CWhat is it that agitates you, my dear Vi=
ctor? What is it you fear?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COh! Peace, peace, my love,=E2=80=9D replied I; =E2=80=9Cthis ni=
ght, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
<p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fe=
arful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I ea=
rnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obta=
ined some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.</p>
<p>She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages =
of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my =
adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture=
 that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his =
menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from th=
e room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rus=
hed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was=
 suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in th=
e extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for an instant; the scream=
 was repeated, and I rushed into the room.</p>
<p>Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destru=
ction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was there, lif=
eless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her p=
ale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I turn I se=
e the same figure=E2=80=94her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the =
murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas! Life is ob=
stinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I =
lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.</p>
<p>When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; the=
ir countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others app=
eared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I esca=
ped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife=
, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the posture=
 in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her ar=
m and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed=
 her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the dea=
dly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my ar=
ms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murde=
rous mark of the fiend=E2=80=99s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had =
ceased to issue from her lips.</p>
<p>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look =
up. The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of =
panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. T=
he shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be =
described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.=
 A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fien=
dish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the =
window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped=
 from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged int=
o the lake.</p>
<p>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the=
 spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets =
were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, =
most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fa=
ncy. After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties goi=
ng in different directions among the woods and vines.</p>
<p>I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the ho=
use, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, =
I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and =
my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I was carried bac=
k and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wande=
red round the room as if to seek something that I had lost.</p>
<p>After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room =
where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I hung=
 over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea =
presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, r=
eflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause. I was bewildered, i=
n a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Just=
ine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I kn=
ew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the f=
iend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest migh=
t be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.=
 I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.</p>
<p>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but =
the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was h=
ardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men =
to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from men=
tal torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and =
the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertio=
n. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to eve=
ry gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar=
 to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before i=
n the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears str=
eamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish pl=
ay in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been ob=
served by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and=
 sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing =
could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from=
 me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable =
as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.</p>
<p>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwh=
elming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their <i>acme=
</i>, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one =
by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength=
 is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous =
narration.</p>
<p>I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk=
 under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old =
man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their =
delight=E2=80=94his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on wit=
h all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having =
few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed =
be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste =
in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated =
around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to ri=
se from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.</p>
<p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and dar=
kness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I drea=
mt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends o=
f my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed,=
 but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation an=
d was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad, and during =
many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.</p>
<p>Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakene=
d to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past mi=
sfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause=E2=80=94the mo=
nster whom I had created, the miserable d=C3=A6mon whom I had sent abroad i=
nto the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when =
I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him wit=
hin my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.</p>
<p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflec=
t on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month af=
ter my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him tha=
t I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and =
that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of th=
e murderer.</p>
<p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. =E2=80=9CBe a=
ssured, sir,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=9Cno pains or exertions on my part sh=
all be spared to discover the villain.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI thank you,=E2=80=9D replied I; =E2=80=9Clisten, therefore, to=
 the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I =
should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which=
, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mi=
staken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.=E2=80=9D My manner =
as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own hea=
rt a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted m=
y agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related my history=
 briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy a=
nd never deviating into invective or exclamation.</p>
<p>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continu=
ed he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder wit=
h horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painte=
d on his countenance.</p>
<p>When I had concluded my narration, I said, =E2=80=9CThis is the being wh=
om I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert y=
our whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope th=
at your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those funct=
ions on this occasion.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own a=
uditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given t=
o a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to=
 act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned.=
 He, however, answered mildly, =E2=80=9CI would willingly afford you every =
aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have pow=
ers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal =
which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man w=
ould venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commis=
sion of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered=
 or what region he may now inhabit.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, an=
d if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the cham=
ois and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do =
not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punis=
hment which is his desert.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated. =
=E2=80=9CYou are mistaken,=E2=80=9D said he. =E2=80=9CI will exert myself, =
and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suf=
fer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have =
yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable=
; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your =
mind to disappointment.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThat cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.=
 My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I c=
onfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is uns=
peakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon so=
ciety, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, an=
d I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.=E2=80=9D=
</p>
<p>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy i=
n my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which t=
he martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, =
whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroi=
sm, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavour=
ed to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effe=
cts of delirium.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMan,=E2=80=9D I cried, =E2=80=9Chow ignorant art thou in thy pr=
ide of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on so=
me other mode of action.</p>

<h2>
<a id=3D"chap24"></a>Chapter 24</h2>
<p>My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowe=
d up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with st=
rength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculati=
ng and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my =
portion.</p>
<p>My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when=
 I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hate=
ful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels whic=
h had belonged to my mother, and departed.</p>
<p>And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have tra=
versed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which=
 travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I have=
 lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the=
 sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not d=
ie and leave my adversary in being.</p>
<p>When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I m=
ight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I=
 wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I =
should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the ce=
metery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it and ap=
proached the tomb which marked their graves. Everything was silent except t=
he leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night w=
as nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to =
an uninterested observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around=
 and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the =
mourner.</p>
<p>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to=
 rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, =
and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass=
 and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, =E2=80=9CBy the sa=
cred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep=
 and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spir=
its that preside over thee, to pursue the d=C3=A6mon who caused this misery=
, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will pr=
eserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun an=
d tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my e=
yes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering=
 ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed a=
nd hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now t=
orments me.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured=
 me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, =
but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.</=
p>
<p>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish lau=
gh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I =
felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that=
 moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my misera=
ble existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengean=
ce. The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparentl=
y close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, =E2=80=9CI am satisf=
ied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil =
eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full u=
pon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.=
</p>
<p>I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a sl=
ight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue Medit=
erranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night =
and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took my passage in =
the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.</p>
<p>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I h=
ave ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horr=
id apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared th=
at if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to g=
uide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge st=
ep on the white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new a=
nd agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel? C=
old, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure;=
 I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet =
still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmu=
red would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.=
 Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a r=
epast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. Th=
e fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I =
will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to a=
id me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by=
 thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revive=
d me, and vanish.</p>
<p>I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the d=C3=A6mon =
generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country =
chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I gen=
erally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with=
 me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I bro=
ught with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part,=
 I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for=
 cooking.</p>
<p>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during =
sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miser=
able, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirit=
s that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness=
 that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this res=
pite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained=
 and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wif=
e, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my fat=
her, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth=E2=80=99s voice, and beheld Cle=
rval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I =
persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I sho=
uld then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonising fo=
ndness did I feel for them! How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometim=
es they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still l=
ived! At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, a=
nd I pursued my path towards the destruction of the d=C3=A6mon more as a ta=
sk enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I w=
as unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.</p>
<p>What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, =
he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that gui=
ded me and instigated my fury. =E2=80=9CMy reign is not yet over=E2=80=9D=
=E2=80=94these words were legible in one of these inscriptions=E2=80=94=E2=
=80=9Cyou live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting=
 ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to wh=
ich I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not too ta=
rdily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to=
 wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure u=
ntil that period shall arrive.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, misera=
ble fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search until he or=
 I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my depa=
rted friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and=
 horrible pilgrimage!</p>
<p>As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and =
the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants w=
ere shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured fort=
h to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places =
to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be pr=
ocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.</p>
<p>The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One=
 inscription that he left was in these words: =E2=80=9CPrepare! Your toils =
only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter=
 upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I =
resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support me, I =
continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocea=
n appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh!=
 How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south! Covered with ice, it w=
as only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedne=
ss. The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hil=
ls of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not =
weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for =
conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adve=
rsary=E2=80=99s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.</p>
<p>Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus =
traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend =
possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost=
 ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first s=
aw the ocean he was but one day=E2=80=99s journey in advance, and I hoped t=
o intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefo=
re, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seash=
ore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate=
 information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, =
armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a s=
olitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off=
 their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he h=
ad seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and t=
he same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his j=
ourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectu=
red that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen=
 by the eternal frosts.</p>
<p>On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair. He=
 had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journ=
ey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the in=
habitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny c=
limate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should li=
ve and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tid=
e, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the=
 spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I=
 prepared for my journey.</p>
<p>I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the=
 Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed f=
rom land.</p>
<p>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured =
misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burnin=
g within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged moun=
tains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of t=
he ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But again the frost came an=
d made the paths of the sea secure.</p>
<p>By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I=
 had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of h=
ope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency=
 and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I =
should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals tha=
t conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice m=
ountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse bef=
ore me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusk=
y plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wil=
d cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportion=
s of a well-known form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisi=
t my heart! Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that the=
y might not intercept the view I had of the d=C3=A6mon; but still my sight =
was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that opp=
ressed me, I wept aloud.</p>
<p>But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their d=
ead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour=E2=
=80=99s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly ir=
ksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor did I =
again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice=
-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained =
on it, and when, after nearly two days=E2=80=99 journey, I beheld my enemy =
at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.</p>
<p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were su=
ddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ev=
er done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the=
 waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and=
 terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, =
as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a trem=
endous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few minutes=
 a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting o=
n a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparin=
g for me a hideous death.</p>
<p>In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and=
 I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw y=
our vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and li=
fe. I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astound=
ed at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, a=
nd by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft i=
n the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southward=
s, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my pu=
rpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue m=
y enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my vi=
gour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardshi=
ps into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the d=C3=A6mon, all=
ow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, s=
wear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and sa=
tisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to undertake m=
y pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not s=
o selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of ve=
ngeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live=E2=80=94swe=
ar that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to=
 the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his w=
ords had even power over my heart; but trust him not. His soul is as hellis=
h as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call =
on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the=
 wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near a=
nd direct the steel aright.</p>

<p class=3D"right">August 26th, 17=E2=80=94.</p>
<p class=3D"noindent">You have read this strange and terrific story, Margar=
et; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which eve=
n now curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not conti=
nue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with diffi=
culty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now =
lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in=
 infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones an=
d related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing ev=
ery mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would =
suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imp=
recations on his persecutor.</p>
<p>His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,=
 yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, =
and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a great=
er conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however=
 earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence! I canno=
t doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavour=
ed to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature=E2=80=99s form=
ation, but on this point he was impenetrable.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAre you mad, my friend?=E2=80=9D said he. =E2=80=9COr whither d=
oes your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself a=
nd the world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not=
 seek to increase your own.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he ask=
ed to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places=
, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he hel=
d with his enemy. =E2=80=9CSince you have preserved my narration,=E2=80=9D =
said he, =E2=80=9CI would not that a mutilated one should go down to poster=
ity.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale=
 that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my soul hav=
e been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own el=
evated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him, yet can I cou=
nsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation=
, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can now know will be when he compos=
es his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the =
offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he hold=
s converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for=
 his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creati=
ons of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions =
of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render=
 them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.</p>
<p>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfort=
unes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge =
and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touchi=
ng; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours t=
o move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creatur=
e must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble an=
d godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his =
fall.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen younger,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=9CI believed myself dest=
ined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a=
 coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sen=
timent of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been o=
ppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those tal=
ents that might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the w=
ork I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rat=
ional animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. B=
ut this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now s=
erves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes ar=
e as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chain=
ed in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis =
and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived t=
he idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect wit=
hout passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my=
 thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their ef=
fects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; b=
ut how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you wou=
ld not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visite=
d my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never=
 again to rise.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I hav=
e sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert=
 seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know hi=
s value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the id=
ea.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI thank you, Walton,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cfor your kind i=
ntentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and=
 fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can a=
ny man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where =
the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the compa=
nions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which =
hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, w=
hich, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and th=
ey can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integri=
ty of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symp=
toms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, wh=
en another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of hi=
mself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only=
 through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I a=
m, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will =
be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one feeling in such a s=
olitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high =
undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creature=
s, then could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursu=
e and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will=
 be fulfilled and I may die.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p class=3D"letter">My beloved Sister,</p>
<p class=3D"right">September 2d.</p>
<p>I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doom=
ed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am s=
urrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every m=
oment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my =
companions look towards me for aid, but I have none to bestow. There is som=
ething terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not=
 desert me. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men a=
re endangered through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.</p>
<p>And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of=
 my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, a=
nd you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My b=
eloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in=
 prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband an=
d lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!</p>
<p>My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He endeav=
ours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he v=
alued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other na=
vigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me w=
ith cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; wh=
en he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while t=
hey hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills =
which will vanish before the resolutions of man. These feelings are transit=
ory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dre=
ad a mutiny caused by this despair.</p>
<p class=3D"right">September 5th.</p>
<p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is h=
ighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear =
recording it.</p>
<p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of=
 being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unf=
ortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolatio=
n. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmer=
s in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertio=
n, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.</p>
<p>I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This =
morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend=E2=80=94his eye=
s half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly=E2=80=94I was roused by half=
 a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They entere=
d, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had=
 been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a =
requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice a=
nd should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, =
the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash eno=
ugh to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they migh=
t happily have surmounted this. They insisted, therefore, that I should eng=
age with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instan=
tly direct my course southwards.</p>
<p>This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived th=
e idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in possib=
ility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein=
, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force en=
ough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flush=
ed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said,</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhat do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, =
then, so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious e=
xpedition? =E2=80=9CAnd wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was =
smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and=
 terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called fort=
h and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and t=
hese you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this w=
as it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the ben=
efactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who e=
ncountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, wi=
th the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and t=
errific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed=
 down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, =
poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides. Why, tha=
t requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged=
 your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards. =
Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as a r=
ock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutabl=
e and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not. Do not return to y=
our families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return as he=
roes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn thei=
r backs on the foe.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expres=
sed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that ca=
n you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were=
 unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had b=
een said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desi=
red the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage wou=
ld return.</p>
<p>They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor =
and almost deprived of life.</p>
<p>How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than retur=
n shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the =
men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue=
 to endure their present hardships.</p>
<p class=3D"right">September 7th.</p>
<p>The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed. Thu=
s are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant an=
d disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this inj=
ustice with patience.</p>
<p class=3D"right">September 12th.</p>
<p>It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility a=
nd glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitte=
r circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards Engla=
nd and towards you, I will not despond.</p>
<p>September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were hea=
rd at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We we=
re in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chie=
f attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in=
 such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked be=
hind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from t=
he west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly fre=
e. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country =
was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and=
 long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of=
 the tumult. =E2=80=9CThey shout,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cbecause they wi=
ll soon return to England.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDo you, then, really return?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAlas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them=
 unwillingly to danger, and I must return.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDo so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpos=
e, but mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but sur=
ely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient stren=
gth.=E2=80=9D Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the e=
xertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.</p>
<p>It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was en=
tirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty a=
nd was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordere=
d us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he told me that my friend ha=
d certainly not many hours to live.</p>
<p>His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I s=
at by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; =
but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, =
said, =E2=80=9CAlas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall =
soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not=
, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatr=
ed and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justifi=
ed in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have bee=
n occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable. In a fi=
t of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towar=
ds him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. =
This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that. My duties =
towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention bec=
ause they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by th=
is view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for =
the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evi=
l; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed =
exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirs=
t for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may render no other wret=
ched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have fai=
led. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake=
 my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced b=
y reason and virtue.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fu=
lfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have li=
ttle chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and=
 the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my =
judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I d=
are not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by pass=
ion.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThat he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me=
; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is th=
e only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the b=
eloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! S=
eek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the ap=
parently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries=
. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet ano=
ther may succeed.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his ef=
fort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted agai=
n to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed f=
or ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.=
</p>
<p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glo=
rious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth o=
f my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble. My t=
ears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But I jour=
ney towards England, and I may there find consolation.</p>
<p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the bree=
ze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there is a soun=
d as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remai=
ns of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine. Good night, my sist=
er.</p>
<p>Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the re=
membrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it;=
 yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final =
and wonderful catastrophe.</p>
<p>I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable =
friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe=E2=80=94=
gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hu=
ng over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; bu=
t one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a=
 mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamat=
ions of grief and horror and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold =
a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousne=
ss. I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my =
duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay.</p>
<p>He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the life=
less form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every featur=
e and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable =
passion.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThat is also my victim!=E2=80=9D he exclaimed. =E2=80=9CIn his =
murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound=
 to its close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does=
 it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed =
thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested =
to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his =
enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I appro=
ached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, t=
here was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to=
 speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter =
wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to add=
ress him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYour repentance,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cis now superfluous. =
If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of rem=
orse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Fran=
kenstein would yet have lived.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAnd do you dream?=E2=80=9D said the d=C3=A6mon. =E2=80=9CDo you=
 think that I was then dead to agony and remorse? He,=E2=80=9D he continued=
, pointing to the corpse, =E2=80=9Che suffered not in the consummation of t=
he deed. Oh! Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine du=
ring the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried=
 me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the groans=
 of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible=
 of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it d=
id not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot=
 even imagine.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAfter the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-br=
oken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abh=
orred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my exist=
ence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that whi=
le he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoym=
ent in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever ba=
rred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiabl=
e thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat and resolved that it should=
 be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, =
but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet cou=
ld not disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had cas=
t off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair=
. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to a=
dapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion o=
f my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; t=
here is my last victim!=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I cal=
led to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persu=
asion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, ind=
ignation was rekindled within me. =E2=80=9CWretch!=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=
=9CIt is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have=
 made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consum=
ed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! If he =
whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he be=
come the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; yo=
u lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your p=
ower.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COh, it is not thus=E2=80=94not thus,=E2=80=9D interrupted the b=
eing. =E2=80=9CYet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appe=
ars to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my =
misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the lov=
e of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole be=
ing overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has b=
ecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitt=
er and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content t=
o suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well sati=
sfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy w=
as soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely=
 hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me fo=
r the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished=
 with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me b=
eneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, =
can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of=
 my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were =
once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the maj=
esty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant d=
evil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his =
desolation; I am alone.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledg=
e of my crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of =
them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured was=
ting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satis=
fy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired l=
ove and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this=
? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against m=
e? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contu=
mely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour =
of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserab=
le and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and tra=
mpled on. Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.</p=
>
<p>=E2=80=9CBut it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely a=
nd the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to=
 death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have de=
voted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and adm=
iration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable =
ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but your abhorre=
nce cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which=
 executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was=
 conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when=
 that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My =
work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man=E2=80=99s death is neede=
d to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be do=
ne, but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform th=
is sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thi=
ther and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall colle=
ct my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its rema=
ins may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would crea=
te such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the ago=
nies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unque=
nched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, th=
e very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see t=
he sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and se=
nse will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some ye=
ars ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, whe=
n I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves=
 and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wep=
t to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes and torn by the=
 bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CFarewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom th=
ese eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive a=
nd yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiate=
d in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my =
extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in som=
e mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst=
 not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted =
as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of=
 remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them=
 for ever.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBut soon,=E2=80=9D he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, =E2=
=80=9CI shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burnin=
g miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and=
 exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagratio=
n will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spir=
it will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Far=
ewell.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft which=
 lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in d=
arkness and distance.</p>
